  <li>11-OCT-2019: The first "official" update released. Aside from an improved web design, it includes translations of Sutra 29 of the <a class="title" href="01_dirgha\contents.html">Long Discourses</a> and Sutras 1-7 of the <a class="title" href="02_madhyama\contents.html">Medium Discourses</a>.</li>
  <li>15-SEP-2009: The <em>Dharma Pearls</em> repo on Github goes public and is published on Guthub Pages. This was a broken web design. The release was simply to walk-through the Github Pages deployment process.</li>
