| [0001b08] 如是我聞：一時，薄伽梵住王舍城鷲峯山頂，與大苾芻眾千二百五十人俱，皆阿羅漢，諸漏已盡無復煩惱，得真自在心善解脫、慧善解脫，如調慧馬亦如大龍，已作所作已辦所辦，棄諸重擔逮得己利，盡諸有結正知解脫，至心自在第一究竟。除阿難陀獨居學地得預流果，大迦葉波而為上首。復有五百苾芻尼眾，皆阿羅漢，大勝生主而為上首。復有無量鄔波索迦、鄔波斯迦，皆見聖諦。| 1.1 Thus have I heard. Once, the Bhagavan was staying at the top of Grdhakuta, near Rajagrha, with a group of 1,250 great bhiksus. They were arahants whose outflows had ended, who were never more to be afflicted, who had attained mastery, well liberated in mind and well liberated in wisdom, who were like tame and intelligent horses or like great nagas, who had done what needed to be done and discerned what needed to be discerned, who had cast off the heavy burden and taken up their own reward, who had ended the bondages of being, who rightly knew liberation and with the utmost mind mastered the first ultimate. This was aside from Ananda, who was the only student and had attained only the fruit of stream-entry. The Great Kasyapa was the foremost among them.
