<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>A number of resources will be added and built up as English translations are released. Many of these resources will mimick what is often found in the back matter of printed books: Indices, appendices, and glossaries. I'll also be writing reading guides, comparisons of Pali and Chinese texts, and the like as time permits.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm focusing on adding entries to the Chinese-English glossary and creating a Pali-Chinese Index of Parallel Texts and Passages. As more material is released, I'll also create indices covering proper names, subjects, stock passages, and technical glosses. Initially, these resources are a secondary goal to translating the source material.</p>
<p>Current resources that are available:</p>

  <li><a href="X2_glossary/index.html">A Chinese-English Glossary of Early Buddhist Texts</a></li>
</ul>
