	<h1>About This Project</h1>
	<p><em>Dharma Pearls</em> is a long-term project to translate Chinese Buddhist texts to modern English. Currently the project is in its initial stages, focusing on the Āgama and Avadāna sections of the Taisho canon. All translations, essays, web design, and images are the work of <a href="mailto:cdpatton2009@gmail.com">Charles Patton</a> unless otherwise noted.</p>
	<p>The intended audience for these translations is both the general reader and the practitioner-scholar who may be interested in the source texts. To this end, both English and Chinese-English glossaries are planned to help readers navigate the language and concepts of the source material.</p>
	<p>I'm also planning comparison studies of the Pali and Chinese parallels of selected texts to highlight the variation exhibited by early Buddhist texts.</p>

	<h2>The Current Translation Projects</h2>
	<p>I've been creating English translations of the four Chinese Āgama collections and the Chinese Dharmapadas since the beginning of 2019, and a number of texts were released initially on the <a class="title" href="https://www.dharmapearls.net" target="_blank">Dharma Pearls</a> Wordpress blog.</p>
	<p>These texts include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a class="title" href="01_dirgha/contents.html">The Long Discourses</a> (Skt. <em>Dīrgha-āgama</em>)</li>
		<li><a class="title" href="02_madhyama/contents.html">The Medium Discourses</a> (Skt. <em>Madhyama-āgama</em>)</li>
		<li><strong>The Related Discourses</strong> (Skt. <em>Samyukta-āgama</em>)</li>
		<li><strong>The Numerical Discourses</strong> (Skt. <em>Ekottarika-āgama</em>)</li>
		<li><strong>Illuminations</strong> (Skt. <em>Udāna</em>)</li>
		<li><strong>A Dharma Collection of Essential Verses</strong> (Skt. <em>Udāna-varga</em>)</li>
		<li><strong>Past Events</strong> (Skt. <em>Itivṛttaka</em>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This initial set of texts comprise a total of 1,422 pages of the Taisho, which will probably translate to around 1.7 million words of English. Quite a project!</p>
