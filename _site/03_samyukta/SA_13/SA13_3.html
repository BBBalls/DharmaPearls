      <section><p id="en.1-1">Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-2">It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Monks, if bad and unwholesome things arise, they all have ignorance as their root. Ignorance collects them, ignorance gives rise to them, and ignorance produces them. What is the reason for that? Someone who’s ignorant lacks knowledge. Wholesome and <span class="taishoref">[198c]</span> unwholesome things aren’t known as they really are: What’s blameworthy and blameless, the lower and higher teachings, what’s stained and stainless, what’s discerned and not discerned, and what’s dependently arisen and not dependently arisen are not known as they really are. When you don’t know them as they really are, you’ll produce wrong views. When you produce wrong views, you can produce wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-3">“If good things arise, they all have understanding as their root. Understanding collects them, understanding gives rise to them, and understanding produces them. With understanding, you’ll know wholesome and unwholesome things as they really are: What’s blameworthy and blameless, those who are friends and not friends, the inferior and superior teachings, what’s polluted and clean, what’s discerned and not discerned, and what’s dependently arisen and not dependently arisen are known as they really are. Knowing things as they really are then is right view. With right view, you can produce right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-4">“After right concentration is produced, the noble disciple attains right liberation from desire, anger, and delusion. After he’s liberated from desire, anger, and delusion, the noble disciple can rightly know and see: ‘My births have ended; the religious practice has been established; and the task has been done.’ He himself knows that he will not be subject to a later existence.”</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-5">After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.</p>
