      <section><p id="en.1-1">Thus have I heard:<sup class="noteref">1</sup> One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-2">There was a monk named Ariṣṭa who went to the Buddha, prostrated at his feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said, “Bhagavān, there’s what’s called ‘deathless.’<sup class="noteref">2</sup> What is called ‘deathless’?”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-3">Buddha addressed Ariṣṭa, “‘Deathless’ is an element named as a description, but I take it to be the possession of the end of contaminants. It’s a clear explanation of this name.”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-4">The monk Ariṣṭa said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps to attain deathlessness when they are cultivated and cultivated often?”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-5">The Buddha addressed the monk, “There is. It’s known as the noble eightfold path, which is right view up to right concentration.”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-6">After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.</p>

</section><h2>Endnotes</h2>
    <ol><li>The Pali parallel is SN.45.7 Dutiyaaññatarabhikkhu. The Pali sutta is only partially parallel, containing a question about the “deathless” and equating it with the end of the contaminants.</li><li>The Chinese translates amṛta as ‘sweet dew’ <span class="ch">甘露</span>, which was a mythical substance considered to be parallel to the Indian concept of soma that was the food of the gods.</li></ol><section class="footer">
