      <section><p id="en.1-1">Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-2">At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Monks, if evil and unwholesome things arise, they all have ignorance as their root. Ignorance collects them, ignorance gives rise to them, and ignorance produces them. What is the reason for that? Ignorance is the lack of knowing. Wholesome and unwholesome things aren’t known as they really are. The blameworthy and blameless, the lower and higher teachings, what’s stained and stainless, what’s discerned and not discerned, what’s dependently arisen and not dependently arisen are not known as they really are. Not knowing them as they really are, a person produces wrong views. After producing wrong views, they can produce wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration.</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-3">“If good things arise, they all have insight as their root. Insight collects them, insight gives rise to them, and insight produces them. With insight, a person knows wholesome and unwholesome things as they really are. The blameworthy and blameless, friends and non-friends, the mean and higher teachings, what’s polluted and clean, what’s discerned and not discerned, what’s dependently arisen and not dependently arisen are known as they really are. Knowing things as they really are is right view. Right view can produce right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-4">“After right concentration is produced, the noble disciple attains right liberation from desire, anger, and delusion. After he’s liberated from desire, anger, and delusion, the noble disciple gains right knowledge and sees: ‘My births have ended; the religious practice has been established; and the task has been done.’ He himself knows that he will not be subject to a later existence.”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-5">After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.</p>
