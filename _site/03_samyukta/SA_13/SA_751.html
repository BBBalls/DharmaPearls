      <section><p id="en.1-1">Thus have I heard:<sup class="noteref">1</sup> One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-2">At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone at home or who has left home undertake wrong affairs, that is not taught by me. What is the reason for that? Someone living at home or who has left home and undertakes wrong affairs won’t be pleased with the right teaching. What are wrong affairs? They are wrong view <em>up to</em> wrong concentration.</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-3">“If someone at home or who has left home undertakes right affairs, that is commended by me. What is the reason for that? Someone who undertakes right affairs is pleased with the right teaching and skilled at the right teaching. What are right affairs? They are right view up to right concentration.”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-4">At that time, Bhagavān spoke in verse:</p>
