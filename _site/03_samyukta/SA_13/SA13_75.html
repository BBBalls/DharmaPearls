<p id="p1">1. Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in Śrāvastī.</p>

<p id="p2">2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks … <em>like 13.74 with this difference:</em> “What’s right view? There are two kinds of right view: Right view that’s worldly, conventional, contaminated, acquired, and which leads to a good destiny, and right view that’s noble, transcendent, uncontaminated, unacquired, and which correctly ends suffering and leads to the limit of suffering.</p>

<p id="p3">3. “What is the right view that’s worldly, conventional, contaminated, acquired, and which leads to a good destiny? If someone’s view is that there’s generosity, there’s the teaching … knowing there are arhats in the world who aren’t subject to a later existence. This is called the worldly right view that’s worldly, conventional, contaminated, acquired, and leads to a good destiny.</p>

<p id="p4">4. “What is the right view that’s noble, transcendent, uncontaminated, unacquired, and which correctly ends suffering and leads to the limit of suffering? It’s the noble disciple’s reflection on suffering as suffering … it’s accumulation … it’s cessation … their reflection on the path as path. When associated with uncontaminated reflection, it’s discrimination of qualities, discernment, inquiry, awareness, intelligence, and rousing investigation. This is called the right view that’s noble, transcendent, uncontaminated, unacquired, and which correctly ends suffering and leads to the limit of suffering.</p>

<p id="p5">5. “What is right intention?

<p id="p6">6. “What is right intention that’s worldly, conventional, contaminated, acquired, and which leads to a good destiny? Right intention is thought of renunciation, thought without anger, and thought that’s not harmful.

There are two kinds of right speech: Right speech that’s worldly, conventional, contaminated, acquired, and which leads to a good destiny, and right speech that’s noble, transcendent, uncontaminated, unacquired, and which correctly ends suffering and leads to the limit of suffering.</p>

<p id="p10">10. “What’s right speech that’s noble, transcendent, uncontaminated, unacquired, and which correctly ends suffering and leads to the limit of suffering? It’s the noble disciple’s reflection on suffering as suffering … it’s accumulation … it’s cessation … his reflection on the path as path. He rids himself of desire for wrong livelihood, the four verbal bad actions, and the other verbal bad actions. Secluded from them, he is uncontaminated, isolated, unattached, resolute, and collected. He doesn’t transgress or act freely given the occasion and doesn’t surpass limitations.
