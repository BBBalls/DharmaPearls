      <section><p id="en.1-1">Thus have I heard:<sup class="noteref">1</sup> One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-2">At that time, the monk Kāma went to the Buddha, prostrated at his feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said, “Bhagavān, there’s what’s called ‘desire.’ What is this ‘desire’?”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-3">The Buddha addressed Kāma, “Desire refers to the qualities of the five desires. What are the five? They are the forms that are cognized by the eye, which are lovely, agreeable, memorable, and support sensual pleasures. Thus are are they the contacts that are cognized by the ear, nose, tongue, and body, which are lovely, agreeable, memorable, and support sensual pleasures. This is called desire but that is not desire. It’s the craving for them that’s called desire.”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-4">At that time, Bhagavān then spoke in verse,</p>

</section>
      <section>
  <ol  id="en.5" start="5" class="verse en">
    <li class="en">
      
      “The world is a mixture of five forms,<br/>
      
      But they aren’t sensual desire.<br/>
      
      It’s craving for sensation and perception<br/>
      
      That’s the desire of men.<br/>
      
      Myriad forms are always present in the world,<br/>
      
      But the practitioner ends his mind’s desire.”<br/>
      
    </li>
  </ol>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-6">The monk Kāma said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps to ending these sensual desires?”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-7">The Buddha told the monk, “There is the right eightfold path that can end sensual desires, which is right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-8">After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monk Kāma who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.</p>

</section><h2>Endnotes</h2>
    <ol><li>This sūtra is a close parallel to <em>SN</em> 45.30 Uttiya, but in the Pali version the interlocutor is Uttiya. Kāma may be the same monk known as Kāmabhū in other Pali sources, but the name is apropos to the subject of the discourse, too. The Pali follows a different presentation of the same meaning and lacks summary verses.</li></ol><section class="footer">
