      <section><p id="en.1-1">Thus have I heard:<sup class="noteref">1</sup> One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-2">It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The fears of lacking mother and son and having mother and son are discussed by foolish and untaught ordinary men, but they aren’t able to understand the fears of lacking mother and son and having mother and son.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-3">“Monks, there are three fears of lacking mother and son that are discussed by foolish and untaught ordinary men. What are the three? Monks, sometimes wars and disorders cause killing in the countryside. [People] flow out in waves and floods as a result. Sons lose their mothers, and mothers lose their sons. This is called the first fear of lacking mother and son that’s discussed by foolish and untaught ordinary men.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-4">“Furthermore, monks, sometimes great fires arise that burn cities and villages. People flee, and mothers and sons lose each other. This is called the second fear of lacking mother and son that’s discussed by foolish and untaught ordinary men.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-5">“Furthermore, monks, sometimes great rains in the mountains cause the rivers to flood, washing away the villages. People flee, and mothers and sons lose each other. This is called the third fear of lacking mother and son that’s discussed by foolish and untaught ordinary men.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-6">“These fears are the fears of having mother and son, but foolish and untaught ordinary men say they are called the fears of lacking mother and son. In those times that wars and disorders cause killing in the countryside, [people] flow out in waves and floods, and mothers and sons lose each other, those same mothers and sons sometimes find each other. This is called the first fear of having mother and son that foolish and untaught ordinary men say is called the fear of lacking mother and son.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-7">“Furthermore, great fires arise that burn cities and villages, and people flee from them. Mothers and sons lose each other, but sometimes they find each other again. This is called the second fear of having mother and son that foolish untaught ordinary men say is called the fear of lacking mother and son.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-8">“Furthermore, great rains in the mountains cause the rivers to flood, washing away villages. The people flee from them, and mothers and sons lose each other, but some find each other. This is the third fear of having mother and son that foolish and untaught ordinary men say is called the fear of lacking mother and son.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-9">“Monks, there are three fears of lacking mother and son as I describe them, being self-realized and perfectly awakened. What are the three? Suppose, monks, that when a son is elderly, he lacks a mother who can say, ‘Son, don’t be old; I’ll take your place.’ When his mother is elderly, she also lacks a son to say, ‘Mother, now don’t be old; I’ll take your place as the old one.’ This is called the first fear of lacking mother amd son as I describe it, being self-realized and perfectly awakened.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-10">“Furthermore, monks, sometimes a son is sick, and his mother can’t say, ‘Son, now don’t be sick; I will take your place.’ When his mother is sick, the son also can’t say, ‘Mother, don’t be sick; I’ll take your place, mother.’ This is called the second fear of lacking mother and son as I describe it, being self-realized and perfectly awakened.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-11">“Furthermore, when a son dies, he has no mother who can say, ‘Son, don’t die now; I’ll take your place.’ When his mother dies, she has no son who can say, ‘Mother, don’t die now; I’ll take your place, mother.’ This is called the third fear of lacking mother and son as I describe it, being self-realized and perfectly awakened.</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-12">The monks said to the Buddha, “Isn’t there a path and steps that put an end to the first three fears of having a mother or son and the latter three fears of lacking a mother or son when cultivated and cultivated often?”</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-13">The Buddha told the monks, “There is a path and steps that put an end to those three fears. What is that path and what are those steps that put an end to the first three fears of having a mother or son and the latter three fears of lacking a mother or son when cultivated and cultivated often? It’s the noble eightfold path and its factors, which are right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.”</p>


</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-14">After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.</p>


</section><h2>Endnotes</h2>
    <ol><li>This sutra is a close parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.62" target="_blank"><em>AN</em> 3.62</a>. The Chinese terms for “fear of lacking mother and son” and “fear of having mother and son” are identical to the Pali when literally read. The three explanations are also very close to the Pali, but in a different order.</li></ol><section class="footer">
