      <section><p id="en.1-1">Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove. </p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-2">It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks: “You must contemplate form as painful. Such contemplation is then right contemplation. Someone who rightly contemplates then becomes disillusioned. Being disillusioned, his delight and greed come to an end. His delight and greed having ended, I say his mind is liberated. </p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-3">“Thus contemplate feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness as painful. Such contemplation is then right contemplation. Someone who rightly contemplates then becomes disillusioned. Being disillusioned, his delight and greed come to an end. His delight and greed having ended, I say his mind is liberated. </p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-4">“So it is, monks, that if someone whose mind is liberated went to realize it himself, then he can realize it: ‘My births have ended; the religious practice has been established; and the task has been done.’ He himself knows that he will not be subject to a later existence.” </p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.1-5">The monks who heard what the Buddha had taught then rejoiced and handed it down.</p>

    <ol><li>This sutra is reconstituted according to the description at 1a14, replacing ‘impermanent’ with ‘painful’ in <em>SA</em> 1.1. It’s parallel to <em>SN</em> 22.13 and 22.51.</li></ol><section class="footer">
