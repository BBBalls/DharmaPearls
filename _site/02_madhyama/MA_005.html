      <section><p id="en.1-1">I have heard thus: One time, the Buddha traveled to Kośala and stayed among the people there. He traveled with an assembly of great monks and followers.</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.2-1">It was then that the Bhagavān suddenly saw from the road a place where there was a large wood pile that was blazing and flaming. After he saw this, the Bhagavān went down to the side of the road, spread out his sitting mat by a tree, and sat down cross-legged.</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.3-1">After he had sat down, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Do all of you see there that large wood pile that’s blazing and flaming?”</p>

</section>
      <section><p id="en.3-2">The monks then answered, “We see it, Bhagavān!”</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.4-1">The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose you embrace, sit, or lay down with that large wood pile that’s blazing and flaming. Suppose it were an aristocrat woman, a priestly, a householder, or a worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry and that you were to embrace, sit, or lay down with her. Which would be pleasant?”</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.5-1">The monks then said, “Bhagavān, that large wood pile is blazing and flaming. If we embraced, sat, or laid with it, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose it were an aristocrat woman, a priestly, a householder, or a worker woman, in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry. To embrace, sit, or lay down with her would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.6-1"><span class="taishoref">[425b]</span> The Bhagavān addressed them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee mendicants will not lose the mendicant path. Those of you who want to achieve the unsurpassed religious practice should rather embrace that wood pile that’s blazing and flaming. If you sit or lay down there, even though it will cause you to suffer pain or die, you won’t be destined to go to an evil place or be born in hell after your body breaks up and your life ends.</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.7-1">“If a foolish man violates the precepts and doesn’t make effort, it creates evil and unwholesome things. His religious practice is not what’s praised as the religious practice; he’s not a mendicant that’s praised as a mendicant.</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.8-1">“Suppose he were to embrace an aristocrat woman, a priestly, a householder, or a worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry, or suppose he were to sit or lay down with her. That foolish man’s long night will be neither good nor purposeful as a result. He’ll experience the results of evil things, and he’ll be destined to go to an evil place or be born in hell after his body breaks up and his life ends.</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.9-1">“Therefore, all of you must examine your own motives, examine the motives of others, and examine the motives of both. You must think, ‘My training as a renunciant is neither vain nor empty; it has its fruit and its result. There is an utmost happiness, birth in good places, and attainment of a long life. I accept the faithful gifts of others for clothes to wear, food to eat, places to sleep, and medicine, and it causes my benefactors to obtain great fortune, obtain great rewards, and obtain great illumination.’ You must perform your training.”</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.10-1">The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who tightly wraps a cord of hair rope around your calf and twists it until it cuts your skin. After cutting skin, it cuts your flesh. After cutting flesh, it cuts your tendons. After cutting tendons, it cuts your bone. After cutting bone, it reaches your marrow and stops. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker who strokes and rubs your body, limbs, and hands and feet. Which would be pleasant?”</p>

</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.11-1">The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man tightly wrapped a cord of hair rope around our calves and twisted it until it cut our skin, cut our flesh after cutting skin, cut our tendons after cutting flesh, cut our bones after cutting tendons, cut our marrow after cutting bones, and stopped, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker who strokes and rubs our body, limbs, and hands and feet. It would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”</p>

      <section><p id="en.47-1">The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.</p>
