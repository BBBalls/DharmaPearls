      <section><p id="en.17-1">“It also means that there are two kinds of people who know the Dharma, know its meaning, go from one teaching to the next teaching, conform to the Dharma, and conduct themselves according to the Dharma: those who benefit themselves, benefit others, benefit many people, pity the world, <span class="taishoref">[422a]</span> seek both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and seek peace and happiness and those who don’t benefit themselves, don’t benefit others, don’t benefit many people, don’t pity the world, don’t seek both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and don’t seek peace and happiness. If someone benefits himself, benefits others, benefits many people, pities the world, seeks both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and seeks peace and happiness, this person is the very best among people. He is great, superior, exceptional, greater, honored, and wondrous.</p>


</section>
    
      <section><p id="en.18-1">“It’s just as there is milk because of the cow, there is cream because of milk, there is butter because of cream, there is refined butter because of butter, and there is ghee because of refined butter. Ghee is the very best of those things. It is great, superior, exceptional, greater, honored, and wondrous. Thus is the person who benefits himself, benefits others, benefits many people, pities the world, seeks both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and seeks peace and happiness. Of these pairs of people as they’ve been described, as they’ve been discerned, and as they’ve been defined, he is the best, great, superior, exceptional, greater, honored, and wondrous. This is called a monk who knows the greater likenesses of people.”</p>
