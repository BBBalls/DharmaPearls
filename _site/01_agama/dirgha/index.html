<h4 id="skt-dīrgha-āgama-ch-長阿含經">(Skt. <em>Dīrgha Āgama</em>; Ch. <span class="ch">長阿含經</span>)</h4>

<p>The Chinese translation of <em>The Long Discourses</em> is a collection of important early Buddhist sutras that’s roughly equivalent to the Pali canon’s <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>. Scholars believe from internal and other evidence that it represents a translation from the Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmaguptaka" target="_blank">Dharmaguptaka</a> canon, which is closely related to the Pali canon in scriptural lineage. It would explain, among other things, the large amount of overlap that we see between the two collections.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the English translations currently available with brief synopses of their contents. Pali equivalents are listed in () and the source text is indicated in [].</p>

<p>DĀ 1 <a href="DA_1.html">The Great Legend</a> (∥ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14" target="_blank">DN 14</a>) [T 1.1b12]</p>

<p class="synopsis">A group of monks gather to discuss Dharma after their meal and discuss the Buddha’s knowledge of buddhas that have existed in the past. They wonder if he knows about them through his own knowledge or because gods tell him. The Buddha overhears their conversation and joins them, giving a lengthy discourse about six buddhas who proceeded him in the distant past. He also gives a second discourse outlining the life of the Buddha Vipaśyin, which is essentially the same as the tradition story of Gautama’s early life and awakening. Finally, the Buddha relates how the Śuddhāvāsa gods, being former disciples of buddhas, have also told him about the buddhas of the past.</p>

<p>DĀ 3 <a href="DA_3.html">Govinda</a> (∥ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn19" target="_blank">DN 19</a>) [T 1.30b11]</p>

<p class="synopsis">A gandharva pays the Buddha a visit to relate to him some happenings in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, and he tells the legend of Govinda through Great Brahmā Kumāra, who told the story at a meeting of gods.

<p class="synopsis">An episode from the Parinirvāṇa Sutra (DĀ 2) is taken up in this sutra, giving more background story. Ānanda wonders why the Buddha hasn’t described the rebirths of devotees from Magadha who’ve passed away, especially the late King Bimbisāra. He urges the Buddha to do so. Afterward, the Buddha encounters a yakṣa spirit named Janavṛṣabha who claims to be have been a former disciple and a king. He tells the Buddha a series of stories about the gods, which the Buddha recounts to Ānanda later.</p>

<p>DĀ 5 <a href="DA_5.html">Smaller Teaching on Origination</a> (∥ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn27" target="_blank">DN 27</a>) [T 1.36b29]</p>

<p class="synopsis">Two priests who converted to the Buddha’s teaching pay him a visit and detail the verbal abuse they’d endured from the other priests.

<p class="synopsis">The Buddha tells the monks to light themselves with the Dharma and make it their refuge. He then relates an elaborate story describing the way the noble wheel-turning kings cultivate the correct teaching that allows them to conquer the world peacefully and maintain that peace in the way they rule. When that teaching is lost, the world descends into immorality and barbarism because the wheel-turning kings forget how to rule properly. After a cycle ending in a genocidal war, people reverse course and rediscover morality and civilization. The story ends with a brief description of the Buddha Maitreya arising. All of this is then revealed as a metaphor for a monk’s spiritual cultivation, which conquers Mara.</p>

<p>DĀ 7 <a href="DA_7.html">Padāśva</a> (∥ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn23" target="_blank">DN 23</a>) [T 1.42b25]</p>

<p class="synopsis">The Buddha’s disciple Kaumāra (or Kumāra) Kāśyapa has an encounter with an unusual priest who holds nihilistic views and engages him in a colorful debate consisting of dueling stories. The priest at the end reveals that he was only testing Kāśyapa and becomes a layman. He assigns a subordinate to arrange for a large donation to the Saṃgha, but gets a dressing down by both Kāśyapa and his subordinate about relying on the merit of alms while still living an immoral life or giving low quality gifts. This sutra is unusual in admitting that it takes place after the Buddha’s Nirvāṇa and lacks the traditional “Thus I have heard” introduction.</p>

<p>DĀ 8 <a href="DA_8.html">Sandhāna</a> (∥ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn25" target="_blank">DN 25</a>) [T 1.47a18]</p>

Śāriputra proceeds to recite a long collection of the Buddha’s teachings in numerical order.</p>

<p>DĀ 10 <a href="DA_10.html">Going Up to Ten</a> (∥ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34" target="_blank">DN 34</a>) [T 1.52c18]</p>

<p class="synopsis">In a similar vein to the previous sutra, the Buddha grows tired after teaching a large assembly of monks well into the night and asks Śāriputra to continue in his stead while he takes a break. What follows is a structured mātṛkā sutra that lists groups of teachings from one to ten items in ascending order. For each numerical group of lists, a set of ten questions are asked, for which the list is an answer.</p>

<p class="synopsis">This mātṛkā sutra is an abbreviated version of the <em>Going Up to Ten Sutra</em> (Skt. Daśottara, P. Dasuttara), listing five sets of items (instead of ten) that number from one to ten items each.</p>

<p class="synopsis">Ānanda has an epiphany about the profundity of the Buddha’s teaching of dependent origination and asks the Buddha about it. The Buddha gives him a lengthy discourse that covers the classic chain of twelve dependent originations and also three other chains of dependent origination. Liberation by wisdom and in both ways is also discussed using the topics of views about self, the abodes of consciousness, and the eight liberations.</p>

The sutra develops from there into a dramatic comedy, culminating in a story of a wanderer who challenges the Buddha to a duel of miracle-working but can’t seem to show up for the event. At the end, the Buddha addresses a series of wrong views held by non-Buddhists about the origin of the world and sentient beings.</p>

<p>DĀ 16 <a href="DA_16.html">Sujata</a> (∥ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn31" target="_blank">DN 31</a>) [T 1.70a20]</p>
