<h3 id="17-cause-and-condition">17. Cause and Condition</h3>

<p id="p1">1. Thus I have heard:<a href="#n1" id="ref1">[1]</a> One time, the Buddha was staying in the Kalandaka’s Bamboo Park of Rājagṛha. At the time, the Venerable Śāriputra and Mahākauṣṭhila was present on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa.</p>

<p id="p2">2. In the afternoon, Mahākauṣṭhila got up from meditation and visited Śāriputra. They exchanged greetings and pleasantries, and then he sat to one side.</p>

<p id="p3">3. Mahākauṣṭhila then said to Śāriputra, “Sir, I would like to ask a question. Would you have a moment to answer it?”</p>

<p>Śāriputra said, “Sir, you may ask. I’ll answer with that I know.”</p>

<p id="p4">4. Mahākauṣṭhila then asked Śāriputra, “If a monk who has yet to attain direct realization wishes to pursue direct realization, what method does he pursue? What teaching does he contemplate?”</p>

<p>Śāriputra replied, “If a monk who has yet to attain direct realization wants to pursue direct realization, he diligently contemplates this: ‘The five acquired aggregates are illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of stream entry.”</p>

<p id="p5">5. Mahākauṣṭhila also asked, “Śāriputra, suppose he wants to realize the fruit of once-returning after realizing the fruit of stream entry. What teaching should he contemplate?”</p>

<p>Śāriputra replied, “Kauṣṭhila, someone who wants to realize the fruit of once-returning after realizing the fruit of stream entry should also diligently contemplate this, ‘The five acquired aggregates are illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of once-returning.”</p>

<p id="p6">6. Mahākauṣṭhila also asked Śāriputra, “Suppose he wants to realize the fruit of non-returning after realizing the fruit of the once-returning. What teaching should he contemplate?”</p>

<p>Śāriputra replied, “Kauṣṭhila, someone who wants to realize the fruit of non-returning after realizing the fruit of once-returning should also diligently contemplate this, ‘The five acquired aggregates are illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates [65c] these five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of non-returning.”</p>

<p id="p7">7. Mahākauṣṭhila also asked Śāriputra, “Suppose he wants to realize the fruit of the arhat after realizing the fruit of non-returning. What teaching should he contemplate?”</p>

<p>Śāriputra replied, “Kauṣṭhila, someone who wants to realize the fruit of the arhat after realizing the fruit of non-returning should also diligently contemplate this, ‘The five acquired aggregates are illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of the arhat.”</p>

<p id="p8">8. Mahākauṣṭhila also asked Śāriputra, “After he attains fruit of the arhat, then what teaching does he contemplate?”</p>

<p>Śāriputra replied, “Mahākauṣṭhila, an arhat also contemplates this, ‘The five acquired aggregates are illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because he has attained what was yet to be attained, realized what was yet to be realized, and sees the teaching’s abode of happiness.”</p>

<p id="p9">9. Those two upright men each heard what was taught, rejoiced, and departed.</p>
