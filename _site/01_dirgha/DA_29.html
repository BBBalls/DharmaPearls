King Prasenajit had awarded this town to that brahmin as his brahmin due.<sup class="noteref">2</sup> This brahmin was descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were proper, so he wasn’t criticized by others. He chanted and fully understood the three divisions of the other canon, and he could entirely discern the various kinds of scriptures.

He was a Tathāgata, an Arhat, and a Perfectly Awakened One fully endowed with the ten epithets. Among gods, worldly men, and demons or the assemblies of Māra’s gods, mendicants, and brahmins, he had himself become realized and taught the Dharma to others. It was good in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in meaning and manner, and the purification of the religious life. “I ought to go and have an audience with such a true man as this.

The Buddha taught the Dharma for him, clearly teaching it with intelligence adnd joy. After that brahmin heard the Dharma, he said to the Buddha, “May the Bhagavān and the great assemblies clearly accept my invitation.” The Bhagavān then accepted his invitation silently.</p>

They got a small sofa for the Buddha to sit in front.
