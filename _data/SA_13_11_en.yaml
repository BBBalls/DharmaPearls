notes:
  - id: 'SA13.11:1.1'
    content: 'This sutra is a close parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.62" target="_blank"><em>AN</em> 3.62</a>. The Chinese terms for “fear of lacking mother and son” and “fear of having mother and son” are identical to the Pali when literally read. The three explanations are also very close to the Pali, but in a different order.'
