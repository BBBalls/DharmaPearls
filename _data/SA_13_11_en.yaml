notes:
  - id: 'SA13.11:1.1'
    content: 'This sutra is a close parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.62" target="_blank"><em>AN</em> 3.62</a>. The Chinese terms for “fear of lacking a mother or son” and “fear of having a mother or son” are identical to the Pali when literally read. The three explanations are also very close to the Pali, but in a different order.'
