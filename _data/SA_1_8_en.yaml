notes:
  - id: 'SA1.8:1.1'
    content: 'This sutra is parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24" target="_blank"><em>SN</em> 22.24</a> and SA 2.8. The Taisho version of this sutra copies the content of SA 1.10 into the beginning, turning it into a “double sutra." I’ve followed Yinshun’s suggestion to delete this material as spurious on the grounds that the uddana for this group of sutras only mentions one sutra on delight. We should also note that SA 2.8 would be a strong parallel if we delete the added material, which then maintains the pattern of SA 1.1-10 corresponding to SA 2.1-10.'
