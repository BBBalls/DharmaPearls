notes:
  - id: 'SA1.5:1.1'
    content: 'This sutra is parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.52" target="_blank"><em>SN</em> 22.52</a> and SA 2.5.'
  - id: 'SA1.5:5.1'
    content: 'The Taisho includes an abbreviated sutra note identical to the one found in SA 1.1 which reads: 如是正思惟無常，苦、空、非我亦復如是. However, it appears to be inconsistent with the summary verse at the end of SA 1.10, and the parallel sutra at SA 2.5 doesn’t have these variants. I have followed Yinshun’s lead in removing the note.'
