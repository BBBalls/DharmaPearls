notes:
  - num: 1
    content: 'Gosira Park. This is the Sanskrit equivalent of Gositarama in Pali sources.'
  - num: 2
    content: <em>carpets, blankets, mattresses</em>. The Chinese for these terms uses obscure classical expressions that were used for different things over the ages. I’ve translated them generally, but the items in the original text may have been more specific than this.
