    content: 'This sutra is reconstituted from a description of variants found after <a href="SA13_7.html" target="_blank"><em>SA</em> 13.7</a>. It’s a variant of <a href="SA13_7.html" target="_blank"><em>SA</em> 13.7</a> in which the Buddha questions the monks rather than being asked a question. It’s also parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.28" target="_blank"><em>SN</em> 45.28</a>.'
