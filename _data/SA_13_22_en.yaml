    content: 'Similar Pali passages are <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.52"><em>AN</em> 5.52</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.5"><em>SN</em> 47.5</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.45"><em>SN</em> 47.45</a>. <em>AN</em> 5.52 and <em>SN</em> 47.5 have only the description of the five coverings. <em>SN</em> 47.45 mentions only the aggregate of the wholesome but defines it as the four abodes of mindfulness. See also <em>EA</em> 32.2 and <em>SA</em> 7.9 and 12.22.'
