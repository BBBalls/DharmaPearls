      content: 'There was a brahmin then named Lohitya<sup class="noteref">3</sup> who was staying in a sal grove. His town was bountiful and happy, and the people were flourishing. King Prasenajit had awarded this town to that brahmin as his brahmin due.<sup class="noteref">4</sup> This brahmin was descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine, so he wasn’t slandered by others. He chanted and fully understood the other canon of three divisions,<sup class="noteref">5</sup> and he could entirely discern the various kinds of scriptures. He was also skilled in the principle of the great man’s signs, divining fortune and misfortune, and sacrifices and rituals.'

      content: 'He heard that the mendicant Gautama of the Śākya clan, who had left the home life <span class="taishoref" id="113a">[113a]</span> and achieved awakening, was touring among the people of Kauśala and had arrived in a rosewood grove. <span class="added">This Gautama</span> had a great reputation that was heard throughout the world. He was a Tathāgata, an Arhat, and a Perfectly Awakened One, fully endowed with the ten epithets. Of gods, worldly men, and demons, whether they were assemblies of Māra’s gods, mendicants, or brahmins, he had himself realized and taught the Dharma for others. It was good in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in meaning and manner, and the purification of the religious life. <span class="added">Lohitya said:</span> “It would be fitting to go and have an audience with such a true man as this. I would like to go and pay him a visit now.”'

      content: 'The brahmin saw that the Buddha was silent. Once he knew that he had <span class="added">the Buddha’s</span> assent, he rose from his seat, circled the Buddha, and left. He wasn’t far away from the Buddha when a bad view occurred to him: “Mendicants and brahmins often know the good Dharma, and many are their proofs, but they shouldn’t teach it to other people. They simply know it for themselves and desist from discussing it with others. It’s like a man who builds a new prison after he destroys an old prison. It’s a greedy, bad, and unwholesome thing!”'

      content: 'The Buddha told Lohitya, “Don’t let this bad view arise again. What is the reason for that? There are three teachers in the world whom it’s possible admonish yourself. Who are the three? One shaves off his hair, wears the three Dharma robes, and leaves home to cultivate the path. Here in the present, he could be rid of the afflictions, and he could develop and attain the state of a superior man. Here in the present, however, he isn’t rid of the afflictions, and he doesn’t attain the state of a superior man. His work is incomplete, yet he teaches the Dharma for his disciples. His disciples don’t respect or serve him. As a result, they again support him and reside with him as equals.'

Here in the present, however, you aren’t able to be rid of the afflictions nor attain the supreme state of a superior man.

notes:
  - num: 1
    content: 'This sutra is a close parallel with Pali <em>DN</em> 12. Aside from differences in details, there are two major departures from the Pali sutta.<br/>
    First, Lohitya visits the Buddha personally to invite him and the monks for a meal. The Buddha gives him a Dharma teaching, which Lohitya apparently finds insulting because he forms a wrong view that religious teachers should keep their teachings to themselves. In the Pali, this encounter doesn’t happen. Instead, Lohicca’s wrong view is simply stated at the outset.<br/>
    The second major difference is that the Q&A between the Buddha and Lohitya takes place at the end of the <em>DA</em> sutra and culminates in Lohitya’s conversion to the Buddha’s teaching. In the Pali, the Q&A section comes before the discourse on the three blameworthy teachers.'
  - num: 2
    content: '<em>*Śālavatī</em>. This is an educated guess based on the Chinese transliteration. Pali: Sālavatikā.<br/>
    <em>rosewood grove</em>. The Chinese appears to transliterate śiṃśapā, which is a Skt. name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalbergia_sissoo" target="_blank"><em>Dalbergia sissoo</em></a> tree, sometimes called Indian rosewood in English.'
  - num: 3
    content: '<em>Lohitya</em>. The Sanskrit name Lohitya is attested in the Sarvâstivāda Dīrghâgama; however, many Central Asian texts give his name as Lokecca. The Chinese transliteration only indicates the first and last syllable (“lo” <span class="ch">露</span> and “cha” <span class="ch">遮</span>).<br/>
    This brahmin appears again in <em>SN</em> 35.132 and <em>SA</em> 255. One of the many curiosities we encounter when comparing the Pali and Chinese, Lohicca converts at the end of <em>SN</em> 35.132 as he does in <em>DN</em> 12, but he simply praises his interlocutor and returns home in <em>SA</em> 255. Thus, in the Pali tradition there appears to be two brahmins named Lohicca, while in the Chinese it may well be the same brahmin.'

    content: '<em>Brahmin due</em> (<span class="ch">梵分</span>) is probably a translation of brahma-deya, which refers to gifts made to the brahmin caste by rulers and others.'
  - num: 5
    content: '<em>other canon of three divisions</em>. Chinese: <span class="ch">異典三部</span>. This appears to describe the three Vedas.'
