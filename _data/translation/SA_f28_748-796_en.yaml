        - taishoref: 'x'
          content: 'At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Just like the first sign of sunrise, which is the first light of dawn, thus does a monk’s right exhaustion of suffering’s limit and the final limit of suffering have a first sign, which is called right view. That right view can produce right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.'

          content: '“Because it produces concentration and right perception, the noble disciple’s mind is rightly liberated from desire, anger, and delusion. His mind thus well liberated, the noble disciple attains right knowledge and sees: ‘My births have ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been done.’ He himself knows that he will not be subject to a later existence.”'

          content: 'At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Monks, if evil and unwholesome things arise, they all have ignorance as their root. Ignorance collects them, ignorance gives rise to them, and ignorance produces them. What is the reason for that? Ignorance is the lack of knowing. Wholesome and unwholesome things aren’t known as they really are. The blameworthy and blameless, the lower and higher teachings, what’s stained and stainless, what’s discerned and not discerned, what’s dependently arisen and not dependently arisen are not known as they really are. Not knowing them as they really are, a person produces wrong views. After producing wrong views, they can produce wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration.'

The blameworthy and blameless, friends and non-friends, the mean and higher teachings, what’s polluted and clean, what’s discerned and not discerned, what’s dependently arisen and not dependently arisen are known as they really are. Knowing things as they really are is right view. Right view can produce right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.'

After right concentration is produced, the noble disciple attains right liberation from desire, anger, and delusion.

They are the forms that are cognized by the eye, which are lovely, agreeable, memorable, and support sensual pleasures. Thus are are they the contacts that are cognized by the ear, nose, tongue, and body, which are lovely, agreeable, memorable, and support sensual pleasures.

        - taishoref: 'x'
          content: 'At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain the learner and non-learner. Listen closely and well consider it. What is a learner? It means a learner’s achievement of right view and a learner’s achievement of right intention, right speech, right action, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called a learner. What is a non-learner? It means a non-learner’s achievement of right view and a non-learner’s achievement of right intention, right speech, right action, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called a non-learner.”'
        - taishoref: 'x'
          content: 'After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.'
