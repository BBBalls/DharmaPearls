          content: 'At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Just like the first sign of sunrise, which is the first light of dawn, thus does a monk’s right exhaustion of suffering’s limit and the final limit of suffering have a first sign, which is called right view. That right view can produce right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.'

          content: '“Because it produces concentration and right perception, the noble disciple’s mind is rightly liberated from desire, anger, and delusion. His mind thus well liberated, the noble disciple attains right knowledge and sees: ‘My births have ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been done.’ He himself knows that he will not be subject to a later existence.”'

        content: 'This discourse is parallel to <em>SN</em> 45.55 <em>Yonisomanasikārasampadā</em>, sharing the metaphor of the rising sun and identifying right view as the forerunner of the eightfold path.'
