notes:
  - id: 'SA13.23:1.1'
    content: 'Pali parallel is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.2"><em>SN</em> 45.2</a>. At first glance, the Pali appears to be an expanded version of this sutra, but the Chinese does indicate that it’s been abbreviated between Ānanda’s initial comment to the Buddha and his reply. See also <em>SA</em> 12.23.'
  - id: 'SA13.23:1.2'
    content: '<em>a mountain valley monastery</em>. The exact location this represents so far is a mystery. The location is found five times in the <em>Saṃyukta Āgama</em>, but it’s not used anywhere else in the Chinese Buddhist canon and doesn’t correspond to a similar location in the parallel Pali passages I could locate.'
