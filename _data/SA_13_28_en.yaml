    content: 'This sutra is reconstituted from a description after <a href="SA13_26.html" target="_blank"><em>SA</em> 13.26</a> at 200b11. It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.117" target="_blank"><em>AN</em> 10.117</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.34" target="_blank"><em>SN</em> 45.34</a>, but the Pali doesn’t have this interlocutor as a variant.'
