notes:
  - id: 'SA13.5:1.1'
    content: 'This sūtra is a close parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.30" target="_blank"><em>SN</em> 45.30</a>, but in the Pali version the interlocutor is Uttiya. Kāma may be the same monk known as Kāmabhū in other Pali sources, but the name is apropos to the subject of the discourse, too. The Pali follows a different presentation of the same meaning and lacks summary verses.'
