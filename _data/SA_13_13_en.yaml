notes:
  - id: 'SA13.13:1.1'
    content: 'This sutra’s introduction is parallel to Pali <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.76" target="_blank"><em>AN</em> 10.76</a>, but it lacks the remainder of that sutta. Another difference is that the Pali lists birth, old age, and death as the three disagreeable things. A similar passage is also found in the beginning of SA 3.25.'
