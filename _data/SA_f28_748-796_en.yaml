They are the covering of greed and the coverings of anger, drowsiness, restlessness, and doubt.'

          content: '<em>Up to</em> the Buddha told Ānanda, “The religious practice is entirely, fully, and purely good friends. What is the reason for that? It was because of good friends that I caused sentient beings to cultivate right view, relying on seclusion, desirelessness, cessation, and oriented towards renunciation <em>up to</em> cultivate right concentration, relying on seclusion, desirelessness, cessation, and oriented towards renunciation.”'
