  <h1>Aggregate</h1>

  <hr/>

<p>G. <em>kaṃdha</em> (<em>kadha</em>), P. <em>khandha</em>, S. <em>skandhaḥ</em>, C. <span class="ch">陰</span> (DĀ, MĀ, EĀ, SĀ, SĀ<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>The term “aggregate” was the label for the items in a list of five types of phenomena that constitute existence on Earth. These five were forms, feelings, conceptualizations, actions, and awareness. Each was referred to as an “aggregate” in the sense of a “conglomeration” or “category of things.” This sense of a multitude of individual things relates to the idea of accumulation and attachment to them being the source of rebirth and suffering.</p>
<p>The early Chinese translation of this term was <span class="ch">陰</span>, which is also the <em>yin</em> of the Chinese concept of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. <span class="ch">陰</span> can mean many things that the Chinese associated with the female principle: cloudy or gloomy weather, shade or shadow, negative (vs. positive), the Moon (vs. the Sun), the shady side of a mountain or river, the back side (vs. the front), the spirit world, and so on. None of these readings seem appropriate for the Buddhist term aggregate.</p> <p>However, we do get a sense of how <span class="ch">陰</span> was understood from a brief gloss in Li Shizheng’s (<span class="ch">李師政</span>, ca. 7th c. CE) <cite>Collected Names and Meanings of Dharma Subjects</cite> (<span class="ch">法門名義集</span>, T2124.54.195a27), which reads:</p>
  <p class="blockquote">The five <em>yin</em>s [aggregates]: Form, feeling, conception, action, and awareness. These five <em>yin</em>s together form a sentient being. What is the form <em>yin</em>? Shaping and obstructing is form. Receiving is feeling. Provisional naming is conception. Producing and making is action. Discerning is awareness. What is the meaning of <em>yin</em>? Sheltering (<span class="ch">陰蓋</span>) and accumulating, they form a sentient being.</p>
<p>In this passage, <span class="ch">陰蓋</span> = <span class="ch">蔭蓋</span>. <span class="ch">蔭</span> is a term that has a more specific meaning of being covered, concealed, or shaded, as when one is standing under a tree or in the undergrowth of a forest. A close equivalent Indic word for <span class="ch">蔭蓋</span> might be P/S. <em>chāyā</em>, which can mean “concealed,” “shaded,” and “reflection” and has the feminine gender. In this way, <span class="ch">陰</span> may have been intended to mean “shelter” or “concealment.”  If true, it would not have been a direct translation of S. <em>skandha</em> but an Indic gloss or interpretation.</p>
<p>Later Chinese translations replaced <span class="ch">陰</span> with more literal equivalents of S. <em>skandha</em> such as <span class="ch">衆</span> (“multitude”) and <span class="ch">蘊</span> (“accumulation”), but these do not appear in the four Āgama collections.</p>
