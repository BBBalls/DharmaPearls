### 5. The Wood Pile Parable

Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha traveled to Kośala and stayed among the people there. He traveled with an assembly of great monks and followers.

It was then that the Bhagavān suddenly saw from the road a place where there was a large wood pile that was blazing and flaming. After he saw this, the Bhagavān went down to the side of the road, spread out his sitting mat by a tree, and sat down cross-legged.

After he had sat down, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Do all of you see there that large wood pile that’s blazing and flaming?”

The monks then answered, “We see it, Bhagavān!”

The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose you embrace, sit, or lay down with that large wood pile that’s blazing and flaming. Suppose it were an aristocrat woman, a priestly, a householder, or a worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry and that you were to embrace, sit, or lay down with her. Which would be pleasant?”

The monks then said, “Bhagavān, that large wood pile is blazing and flaming. If we embraced, sat, or laid with it, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose it were an aristocrat woman, a priestly, a householder, or a worker woman, in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry. To embrace, sit, or lay down with her would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”

[425b] The Bhagavān addressed them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee mendicants will not lose the mendicant path. Those of you who want to achieve the unsurpassed religious practice should rather embrace that wood pile that’s blazing and flaming. If you sit or lay down there, even though it will cause you to suffer pain or die, you won’t be destined to go to an evil place or be born in hell after your body breaks up and your life ends.

“If a foolish man violates the precepts and doesn’t make effort, it creates evil and unwholesome things. His religious practice is not what’s praised as the religious practice; he’s not a mendicant that’s praised as a mendicant.

“Suppose he were to embrace an aristocrat woman, a priestly, a householder, or a worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry, or suppose he were to sit or lay down with her. That foolish man’s long night will be neither good nor purposeful as a result. He’ll experience the results of evil things, and he’ll be destined to go to an evil place or be born in hell after his body breaks up and his life ends.

“Therefore, all of you must examine your own motives, examine the motives of others, and examine the motives of both. You must think, ‘My training as a renunciant is neither vain nor empty; it has its fruit and its result. There is an utmost happiness, birth in good places, and attainment of a long life. I accept the faithful gifts of others for clothes to wear, food to eat, places to sleep, and medicine, and it causes my benefactors to obtain great fortune, obtain great rewards, and obtain great illumination.’ You must perform your training.”

The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who tightly wraps a cord of hair rope around your calf and twists it until it cuts your skin. After cutting skin, it cuts your flesh. After cutting flesh, it cuts your tendons. After cutting tendons, it cuts your bone. After cutting bone, it reaches your marrow and stops. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker who strokes and rubs your body, limbs, and hands and feet. Which would be pleasant?”

The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man tightly wrapped a cord of hair rope around our calves and twisted it until it cut our skin, cut our flesh after cutting skin, cut our tendons after cutting flesh, cut our bones after cutting tendons, cut our marrow after cutting bones, and stopped, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker who strokes and rubs our body, limbs, and hands and feet. It would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”

The Bhagavān addressed them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee mendicants will not lose the mendicant path. Those of you who want to achieve the unsurpassed religious practice should rather allow a strong man to tightly wrap a cord of hair rope around your calf and twist it until it cuts your skin, cuts your flesh after cutting skin, cuts your tendons after cutting flesh, cuts your bone after cutting tendons, cuts your marrow after cutting bone, and stops. Even though it will cause you to suffer pain or die, you won’t be destined to go to an evil place or [425c] be born in hell after your body breaks up and your life ends.

“If a foolish man violates the precepts and doesn’t make effort, it creates evil and unwholesome things. His religious practice is not what’s praised as the religious practice; he’s not a mendicant that’s praised as a mendicant.

“Accepting a faithful gift from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker who strokes and rubs his body, limbs, and hands and feet, that foolish man’s long night will be neither good nor purposeful as a result. He’ll experience the results of evil things, and he’ll be destined to go to an evil place or be born in hell after his body breaks up and his life ends.

I accept the faithful gifts of others for clothes to wear, food to eat, places to sleep, and medicine, and it causes my benefactors to obtain great fortune, obtain great rewards, and obtain great illumination.’ You must perform your training.”

The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who uses a brightly polished and sharpened sword to chop off your [leg at the] hip, and suppose you were to accept a faithful gift from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker who venerates, respects, and looks after you. Which would be pleasant?”

The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man used a brightly polished and sharpened sword to chop off our [legs at the] hip, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker who venerates, respects, and looks after us. It would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”

He’ll experience the results of evil things, and he’ll be destined to go to an evil place or be born in hell after his body breaks up and his life ends.

The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, [426a] “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who wraps a blazing and flaming iron or copper plate around your body, and suppose you were to accept a faithful gift of clothing from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker. Which would be pleasant?”

The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man wrapped a blazing and flaming iron or copper plate around our bodies, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift of clothing from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker. It would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”

The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who opens your mouth with hot iron forceps and then puts in a blazing and flaming iron ball. That hot iron ball burns your lips. After it burns your lips, it burns your tongue. After it burns your tongue, it burns your gums. After it burns your gums, it burns your throat. After it burns your throat, it burns your heart. After it burns your heart, it burns your intestines and stomach. After it burns your intestines and stomach, it falls through to the ground. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift of food with measureless flavors from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker. Which would be pleasant?”

The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man opened our mouths with hot iron forceps and then put in a blazing and flaming iron ball, that hot iron ball would burn our lips. After it burns our lips, it would burn our tongues. After it burns our tongues, it would burn our gums. After it burns our gums, it would burn our throats. After it burns our throats, it would burn our hearts. After it burns our hearts, it would burn our intestines and stomachs. After it burns our intestines and stomachs, [426b] it would fall through to the ground. It would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift of food with measureless flavors from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker. It would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”

The Bhagavān addressed them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee mendicants will not lose the mendicant path.

The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who forces a servant to sit or lay down on an iron or copper bed that’s blazing and flaming. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift of a bed or sofa to lay on from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker. Which would be pleasant?

The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man forced a servant to sit or lay down on an iron or copper bed that’s blazing and flaming, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift of a bed or sofa to lay on from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker. It would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”

The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who picks up a person and puts them head first into a large iron or copper cauldron that’s blazing and flaming. Suppose you were to accept the faithful gift of a dwelling from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker, and it’s coated in plaster, its windows and doors are secure and private, and it has a fireplace for warmth. Which would be pleasant?”

The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man picked up a person and put them head first into a large iron or copper caldron that’s blazing and flaming, it would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept the faithful gift of a dwelling from an aristocrat, priest, householder, or worker, and it’s coated in plaster, its windows and doors are secure and private, and it has a fireplace for warmth.

I accept the faithful gifts of others for clothes to wear, food to eat, places to sleep, and medicine, and it causes my benefactors to obtain great fortune, obtain great rewards, and obtain great illumination.’ You must perform your training.”

When he spoke this teaching, the contaminants ended for 60 monks, and they were freed from the bonds. 60 monks renounced the precepts and returned home. What was the reason for that? The Bhagavān’s instructions were extremely profound and difficult. The path of training was also extremely profound and difficult.

The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.
