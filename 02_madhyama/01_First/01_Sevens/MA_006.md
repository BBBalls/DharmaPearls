### 6. The Good Person’s Departure

Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha traveled to the kingdom of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.

At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain for you the seven places to which a good person goes as well as nirvāṇa without remainder. Listen closely, listen closely, and well consider it!”

The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.

The Buddha said, “What are the seven? A monk’s practice ought to be thus: ‘I have no self and nothing is mine. In the future, there’ll be no self, and nothing will be mine.’ He readily ends what has been, and he attains equanimity after ending it. The pleasures he has don’t stain him, and he doesn’t cling to what has come together. Such a practitioner sees by the wisdom of an unsurpassed stillness [of mind], but he has yet to attain its realization.

“Where will a monk who practices thus go? It’s like setting fire to wheat chaff, which burns at little and then goes out. You should know that monk to be likewise. With a little conceit that’s yet to end, he has cut the five lower bonds and will attain parinirvāṇa in the interim. This is called the first place to which a good person goes. The world in truth does have such people.

“Furthermore, a monk’s practice ought to be thus: ‘I have no self and nothing is mine. In the future, there’ll be no self, and nothing will be mine.’ He readily ends what has been, and he attains equanimity after ending it. The pleasures he has don’t stain him, and he doesn’t cling to what has come together. Practicing thus, he sees by the wisdom of an unsurpassed stillness [of mind], but he has yet to attain its realization.

“Where will a monk who practices thus go? It’s like striking a blazing and flaming iron with a hammer, and a spark flies off into space and goes out after rising. You should [427b] know that monk to be likewise. With a little conceit that’s yet to end, he has cut the five lower bonds and will attain parinirvāṇa in the interim. This is called the second place to which a good person goes. The world in truth does have such people.

“Where will a monk who practices thus go? It’s like striking a blazing and flaming iron with a hammer, and a spark flies off into space. After rising, it comes back down but goes out before reaching the ground. You should know that monk to be likewise. With a little conceit that’s yet to end, he has cut the five lower bonds and attains parinirvāṇa in the interim. This is called the third place to which a good person goes. The world in truth does have such people.

“Where will a monk who practices thus go? It’s like striking a blazing and flaming iron with a hammer, and a spark flies off into space, falls to the ground, and goes out. You should know that monk to be likewise. With a little conceit that’s yet to end, he has cut the five lower bonds and will attain parinirvāṇa at birth. This is called the fourth place to which a good person goes. The world in truth does have such people.

“Where will a monk who practices thus go? It’s like striking a blazing and flaming iron with a hammer, and a spark flies off into space. It falls onto a little wood or grass, smokes or burns, and then goes out after burning. You should know that monk to be likewise. With a little conceit that’s yet to end, he has cut the five lower bonds and will attain parinirvāṇa with practice. This is called the fifth place to which a good person goes. The world in truth does have such people.

The pleasures he has don’t stain him, and he doesn’t cling to what has come together. Practicing thus, he sees by the wisdom of [427c] an unsurpassed stillness [of mind], but he has yet to attain its realization.

“Where will a monk who practices thus go? It’s like striking a blazing and flaming iron with a hammer, and a spark flies off into space. It falls onto a little wood or grass, smokes or burns, and then goes out after burning up completely. You should know that monk to be likewise. With a little conceit that’s yet to end, he has cut the five lower bonds and will attain parinirvāṇa without practice. This is called the sixth place to which a good person goes. The world in truth does have such people.

“Where will a monk who practices thus go? It’s like striking a blazing and flaming iron with a hammer, and a spark flies off into space. It falls onto a little wood or grass and smokes or burns. Once it’s burning, it then sets fire to a town, a city, a forested mountain, or a wilderness. After it burns that town, city, forested mountain, or wilderness, it might reach a road, water, or a plain and go out. You should know that monk to be likewise. With a little conceit that’s yet to end, he has cut the five lower bonds and will attain parinirvāṇa upstream in Akaniṣṭha. This is called the seventh place to which a good person goes. The world in truth does have such people.

“What is nirvāṇa without remainder? A monk’s practice ought to be thus: ‘I have no self and nothing is mine. In the future, there’ll be no self, and nothing will be mine.’ He readily ends what has been, and he attains equanimity after ending it. The pleasures he has don’t stain him, and he doesn’t cling to what has come together. Practicing thus, he sees by the wisdom of an unsurpassed stillness [of mind], and he has attained its realization.

“I say that monk doesn’t go east, and he doesn’t go west, south, north, the four counterpoints, up, or down. In the present, he readily stills [his mind] and is completely liberated.

“I had said I would explain the seven places to which a good person goes as well as the nirvāṇa without remainder, and for that reason I have explained it.”

The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.
