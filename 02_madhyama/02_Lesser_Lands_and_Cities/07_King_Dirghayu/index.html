<p class="synopsis">The Buddha visits the monks in Kauśāmbī to find them quarrelling with each other constantly. He tells them the legend of King Dīrghāyu, a story about how a feud between two kings was ended, in an attempt to convince them to stop. Failing that, he leaves and travels alone. He meets with Venerable Bhagu, who was practicing alone in a temple grove. After a brief conversation, the Buddha goes to another grove to spend some time alone. There he meets an elephant who happens by after leaving his herd for some time alone. Finally, the Buddha travels to a grove where Venerable Aniruddha, Nandika, and Kimbila are living together and practicing meditation. He gives them a lengthy discourse on 11 things that impede deep concentration.</p>
