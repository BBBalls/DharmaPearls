  <h1>The Long Discourses</h1>
  <h4>(Skt. <span class="skt">Dīrgha Āgama</span>; Ch. <span class="ch">長阿含經</span>)</h4>
<p>The Chinese translation of <em>The Long Discourses</em> is a collection of important early Buddhist sutras that's roughly equivalent to the Pali canon's <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>. Scholars believe from internal and other evidence that it represents a translation from the Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmaguptaka#Twelve_a%E1%B9%85gas" target="_blank">Dharmaguptaka</a> canon, which is closely related to the Pali canon in scriptural lineage. It would explain, among other things, the large amount of overlap that we see between the two collections.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the English translations currently available with brief synopses of their contents. Pali equivalents are listed in () and the sourcetext is indicated in [].</p>

<p class="synopsis">King Ajātaśatru decides to visit the Buddha on an auspicious full moon night with his brother Jīvaka. He asks the Buddha what the fruits of the ascetic life are in the present and relates the various responses he received from the six heretical teachers. The Buddha explains in a matter-of-fact way the various rewards the ascetic life has, ranging from receiving charity to honors from kings like himself. King Ajātaśatru repents his past transgressions and takes refuge as a layman.</p>

<p class="synopsis">A brahmin lord named Lohitya hears that the famous mendicant teacher Gautama has stopped nearby. He decides to meet the Buddha, so he invites him to share a meal at his residence. When the Buddha gives him an unrequested Dharma teaching, however, Lothitya is offended and forms a wrong view that religious teachers shouldn't teach others for their own gain. The Buddha tells him about three cases when a teacher does warrant censure and explains why his view is mistaken.</p>
