  <h1>The Long Discourses</h1>
  <h4>(Skt. <span class="skt">Dīrgha Āgama</span>; Ch. <span class="ch">長阿含經</span>)</h4>
<p>The Chinese translation of <em>The Long Discourses</em> is a collection of important early Buddhist sutras that's roughly equivalent to the Pali canon's <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>. Scholars believe from internal and other evidence that it represents a translation from the Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmaguptaka#Twelve_a%E1%B9%85gas" target="_blank">Dharmaguptaka</a> canon, which is closely related to the Pali canon in scriptural lineage. It would explain, among other things, the large amount of overlap that we see between the two collections.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the English translations currently available with brief synopses of their contents. Pali equivalents are listed in () and the sourcetext is indicated in [].</p>

<p>A brahmin lord named Lohitya hears that the famous mendicant teacher Gautama has stopped nearby. He decides to meet the Buddha, so he invites him to share a meal at his residence. When the Buddha gives him an unrequested Dharma teaching, however, Lothitya is offended and forms a wrong view that religious teachers shouldn't teach others for their own gain. The Buddha tells him about three cases when a teacher does warrant censure and explains why his view is mistaken.</p>
