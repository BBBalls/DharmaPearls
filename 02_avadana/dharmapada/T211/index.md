He's briefly reborn to a potter's wife, but she miscarries, and Śakra is immediately reborn as Śakra again. When he returns to the Buddha to tell this tale, the Buddha recites verses 1-2 of the *Dharmapāda*. Śakra has an epiphany and attains stream entry.

3. [Like Cattle Led to Their Slaughter](T211c1v4-6.html) (verses 4-6)

On the way back from giving a teaching in Rājagṛha, the Buddha and his assembly see a cowherd bringing a herd of cattle back to the city from grazing, which were fattened and ready for slaughter. Inspired by this, Buddha composes three verses about the impermanence of life. Later, Ānanda asks him the meaning of the verses 4-6, and the Buddha explains that ordinary people are like the cattle, not aware of when their deaths will arrive.
