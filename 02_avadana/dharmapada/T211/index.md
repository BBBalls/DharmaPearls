Chapter 1: Impermanence
1. [Śakra Attains Stream Entry](T211c1v1-2.html) (v.2-3)

Just before passing away in the Trayastriṃśa Heaven, Śakra earnestly takes refuge in the  Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. He's briefly reborn to a potter's wife, but she miscarries when disciplined for breaking the family's pottery. Śakra is immediately reborn as Śakra again. When he returns to the Buddha to tell this tale, the Buddha praises him and recite verses 1-2 of the *Dharmapāda*. Śakra has an epiphany and attains stream entry.
