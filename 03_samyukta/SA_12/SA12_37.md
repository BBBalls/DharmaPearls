### 37. Seven Fruits

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta’s Grove in Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. *Like 12.34 above except for this:* “Suppose a monk cultivates the seven factors of awakening. After often cultivating them, he’ll attain seven fruits. What are the seven? This refers to nirvāṇa with remainder when he attains knowledge in the present life and [nirvāṇa] at his life’s end when he doesn’t attain knowledge in the present life. If that isn’t the case, he’ll end the five lower bonds and attain parinirvāṇa in the interim. If that’s not the case, then he’ll attain parinirvāṇa at birth. If that’s not the case, he’ll attain parinirvāṇa without practice. If that’s not the case, he’ll attain parinirvāṇa with practice. If that’s not the case, he’ll attain parinirvāṇa upstream.”
{: #p2}

3\. After the Buddha taught this sūtra, the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved.
