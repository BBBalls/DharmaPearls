### 58. Wrong View Regarding Knowing and Seeing

1\. Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “What is it that exists, that arises, that ties, that’s an attachment, and that’s viewed as self and causes sentient beings to create such views and such statements? ‘Knowing and seeing in sentient beings has no cause and no condition.’”
{: #p2}

3\. The monks then said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān is the Dharma root, the Dharma eye, and the Dharma refuge …” *It’s thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras (35.7-9) above.*
{: #p3}
