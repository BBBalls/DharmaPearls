### 40. Wrong View Regarding Actions

1\. Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove in Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “What is it that exists, that arises, that ties, that’s an attachment, and that’s viewed as self and causes sentient beings to create such views and such statements? ‘There’s no generosity, no congregation, no teaching, and no results of good or bad destinies from actions. There’s no present or other world, no mother or father, and no sentient beings. There are no arhats in the world who rightly arrive at the right destination or who themselves see the Dharma and know they’ve realized it fully, whether it’s in the present or another world: “My births have ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished, and I  know I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’
{: #p2}

3\. The monks said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān is the Dharma root, the Dharma eye, and the Dharma refuge …” *It’s thus explained in detail and in the sequence of the three sutras (35.7-9) above.*
