### 10. Delighting in Form

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When you delight in form, you delight in suffering. Delighting in suffering, you can’t be liberated from suffering. Thus, when you delight in feeling … perception … volition … consciousness, you delight in suffering. Delighting in suffering, you can’t be liberated from suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, when you don’t delight in form, you don’t delight in suffering. Not delighting in suffering, you can be liberated from suffering. Thus, when you don’t delight in feeling … perception … volition … consciousness, you don’t delight in suffering. Not delighting in suffering, you can be liberated from suffering.”
{:#p3}

4\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught then rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}
