### 12. Past (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Past and future form is painful, so why wouldn’t present form [be painful]? Noble disciples thus observe them, not looking back to past form and not wishing for future form. They tire and become free of desire for present form, being correctly oriented toward its cessation. Thus, past and future feeling … perception … volition … consciousness is painful, so why wouldn’t present consciousness [be painful]? Noble disciples thus observe them, not looking back to past consciousness and not wishing for future consciousness. They tire and become free of desire for present consciousness, being correctly oriented toward its cessation.”
{:#p2}

3\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught then rejoiced and approved.
{:#p3}
