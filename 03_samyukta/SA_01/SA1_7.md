### 7. Not Knowing (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When you don’t know and don’t understanding form, don’t stop and become free of desire for it, and your mind isn’t liberated, you aren’t able to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death. Thus, when you don’t know and don’t understanding sensation … perception … volition … consciousness, don’t stop and become free of desire for it, and your mind isn’t liberated, you aren’t able to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you know and understand form, if you end and become free of desire for it, and your mind is liberated, you’ll be able to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death. Thus, if you know and understand sensation … perception … volition … consciousness, if you end and become free of desire for them, and your mind is liberated, you’ll be able to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death.”
{:#p3}

4\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught then rejoiced and approved.
