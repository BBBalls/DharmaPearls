### 8. Not Knowing (3)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When you don’t know and don’t understand form, don’t become free of desire for it, and your mind isn’t liberated, you aren’t able to stop suffering. Thus, when you don’t know and don’t understand sensation … perception … volition … consciousness, don’t become free of desire for it, and your mind isn’t liberated, you aren’t able to stop suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you know and understand form, if you become free of desire for it, and your mind is liberated, you’ll be able to stop suffering. Thus, if you know and understand sensation … perception … volition … consciousness, if you become free of desire for it, and your mind is liberated, you’ll be able to [1c] stop suffering.”
{:#p3}

4\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught then rejoiced and approved.

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This sutra is parallel to [SN 22.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24){:target="_blank"} and SĀ 2.8. The Taisho version of this sutra copies the content of SĀ 1.10 into its beginning, turning it into a “double sutra." I’ve followed Yinshun’s suggestion to delete this material as spurious on the grounds that the uddāna for this group of sutras only mentions one sutra on delight. We should also note that SĀ 2.8 would be a strong parallel if we delete the added material, which then maintains the pattern of SĀ 1.1-10 corresponding to SĀ 2.1-10. [\[back\]](#ref1)
