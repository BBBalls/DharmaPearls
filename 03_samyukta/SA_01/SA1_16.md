### 16. Teaching Liberation

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Form is impermanent. What’s impermanent is painful. What’s painful is not self. What’s not self doesn’t belong to self. Such observation is called true and correct observation. Thus, feeling … perception … volition … consciousness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is painful. What’s painful is not self. What’s not self doesn’t belong to self. Such observation is called true and correct observation.
{:#p2}

3\. “Noble disciples who thus observe are liberated from form and liberated from sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness. I say that this is complete liberation from birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and vexation.”
{:#p3}

4\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
