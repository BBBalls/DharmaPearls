### 21. Arising of the Noble Path (2)

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, Suppose a monk’s right view is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. “When it has yet to happen, it doesn’t happen except by the discipline of the Sugata ... *up to right concentration are likewise described*. Suppose right view is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. When it has yet to happen, it can happen ... *up to right concentration are likewise described*.”
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.
{:#p3}

### Notes
1. {:#n1}This sutra is reconstituted from a description after SA 23.20 at 200b22, replacing “Buddha” with “Sugata.” It’s parallel to [*SN* 45.17](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.17){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
