### 9. The Gathered Saṅgha

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was travelling among the Mallas. Accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks, he eventually arrived at Cunda’s Mango Grove of Pāpā.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2}
{:#p1}

2\. It was the fifteenth-day full moon when the Bhagavān sat in an open area with the assembly of monks both in front and behind him. After he had given them many discourses on the Dharma that evening, the Bhagavān addressed Śāriputra: “The monks have gathered today from the four directions to diligently apply themselves together. They aren’t sleepy yet, but I’m suffering from back pain. I’d like to take a break for a while. Perhaps you can explain the Dharma for the monks now?”
{:#p2}

Śāriputra replied, “Very well. I’ll explain the noble teaching.”

3\. The Bhagavān folded his outer robe four times and laid on his right side like a lion with his feet together.
{:#p3}

4\. Śāriputra then told the monks, “Now, here in this city of Pāpā, it hasn’t been long since Nirgrantha Jñātaputra’s life ended. Since then, his disciples have split into two factions that constant argue and look for shortcomings to reproach each other. They contradict each other, saying: ‘I know this teaching.’ ‘You don’t know this.’ ‘You hold wrong views.’ ‘I hold to the right teaching.’ Their words are confused and without proper order. They consider statements praising themselves to be true, saying: ‘My statement is the winner; your words are defeated. I’m the one who gives discourses now. Come and ask me when you have questions.’
{:#p4}

5\. “Monks, the people of the country who make offerings to the Nirgranthas are weary and troubled by the noise of their fighting. As a result, they consider their teaching to be untrue. A teaching that’s untrue has no way to escape, just as a ruined shrine cannot be repainted. It’s not the teaching of a completely awakened one. Monks, only we Śākyans have the unsurpassed, noble teaching that’s truest and can lead to the escape, just as a newly built shrine is easily decorated. It’s the teaching of a completely awakened one.
{:#p5}

128\. “There are another six things, which are six spheres of escape: [1] Suppose a monk says, ‘I’d cultivate kindness, but then I become angry.’ The other monks say, ‘Don’t say that! Don’t misrepresent the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata doesn’t say, “I’d like to cultivate the liberation of kindness, but then notions of anger arise.” That’s impossible. The Buddha says, “Once anger is gone, then one becomes kind afterward.”’

### Notes

1. {:#n1} The direct parallels for this sutra are [DN 33](https://suttacentral.net/dn33){: target="_blank"} and T 12. We should also note that there’s substantial overlap with [DN 34](https://suttacentral.net/dn34){: target="_blank"}, DĀ 10, DĀ 11, and T13. All of these sutras collect teachings into a numerically organized list. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}Pāpā. Ch. 波婆 (MCh. pua-b’ua), P. Pāvā, Skt. Pāpā. I’ve adopted the Skt. attestation, but the Chinese transliteration matches the Pali in this case. [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3}*All sentient beings are reborn as a result of their actions.* Ch. 一切眾生皆由行往. There is an alternate reading of this line in the Ming edition that substitutes 住 for 往, which would indeed more closely match Skt. sarvasatvāḥ saṃskārasthāyinaḥ. The Japanese translators chose to amend the Taisho here, but I’m less convinced given how often DĀ diverges from later Skt. and P. sources. If I were to amend 往 to 住, the passage would read “All sentient beings abide as a result of their actions.” The difference is not great; both readings point to the conditioned genesis of beings. [\[back\]](#ref3)
4. {:#n4}*emptiness … without aspirations … without attributes*. The order of these three samādhis differs from that found in DĀ 10 and DĀ 11, switching the usual position of the second and third samādhis. The translation of the samādhi without aspirations also differs from the other two passages (無願 vs. 無作). This appears to be an inconsistency internal to DĀ, perhaps a translation or copyist error, until we notice that the same order occurs in a Song translation of a different Saṅgīti Sūtra (cf. T12.228a19ff). So, this appears to represent a different version of the three samādhis peculiar to the *Saṅgīti Sūtra*. [\[back\]](#ref4)
5. {:#n4}*Misapplied precepts*. Literally, the Chinese reads “thief of precepts” (戒盜). [\[back\]](#ref5)
6. {:#n5}*foundations*. The Chinese translates Skt. pada literally as “foot,” but it’s likely a figurative expression for a support like the individual legs of a chair. [\[back\]](#ref6)
