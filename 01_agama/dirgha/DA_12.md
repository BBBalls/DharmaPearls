## 12. Three Categories

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a great assembly of 1,250 monks.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will give all of you a discourse on the sublime teaching, the content and expression of which is pure and perfects the religious life. It’s the teaching in three categories. All of you, listen closely and consider it. I will teach this for you.”
{:#p2}

The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.

3\. The Buddha addressed the monks, “These three categories are one thing that leads to bad destinies, one thing that leads to good destinies, and one thing that leads to <em>nirvāṇa</em>.
{:#p3}

4\. “What’s one thing that leads to bad destinies? It’s the absence of kindness that harbors harmful thoughts. This is one thing that leads to bad destinies.
{:#p4}

5\. “What’s one thing that leads to good destinies? It’s not inflicting bad intent on sentient beings. This is one thing that leads to good destinies.
{:#p5}

6\. “What’s one thing that leads to <em>nirvāṇa</em>? It’s making effort to cultivate the abodes of mindfulness. This is one thing that leads to <em>nirvāṇa</em>.

I’m the Tathāgata; I’ve provided all that I should for you. Taking pity on you, I’ve lectured on the sutras and the path. You should also take pity on yourselves and go to a quiet place under a tree or in an empty dwelling to contemplate. Don’t be negligent. Nothing’s gained by not exerting yourselves today and regretting it later.”
{:#p43}

44\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
