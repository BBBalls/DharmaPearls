# The Long Discourses
#### (Skt. *Dīrgha Āgama*; Ch. <span class="ch">長阿含經</span>)

The Chinese translation of *The Long Discourses* is a collection of important early Buddhist sutras that's roughly equivalent to the Pali canon's *Dīgha Nikāya*. Scholars believe from internal and other evidence that it represents a translation from the Indian [Dharmaguptaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmaguptaka){:target="_blank"} canon, which is closely related to the Pali canon in scriptural lineage. It would explain, among other things, the large amount of overlap that we see between the two collections.

Below is a list of the English translations currently available with brief synopses of their contents. Pali equivalents are listed in () and the sourcetext is indicated in [].
