# The Long Discourses
#### (Skt. *Dīrgha Āgama*; Ch. <span class="ch">長阿含經</span>)

The Chinese translation of *The Long Discourses* is a collection of important early Buddhist sutras that’s roughly equivalent to the Pali canon’s *Dīgha Nikāya*. Scholars believe from internal and other evidence that it represents a translation from the Indian [Dharmaguptaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmaguptaka){:target="_blank"} canon, which is closely related to the Pali canon in scriptural lineage. It would explain, among other things, the large amount of overlap that we see between the two collections.

Below is a list of the English translations currently available with brief synopses of their contents. Pali equivalents are listed in () and the source text is indicated in [].

DĀ 1 [The Great Legend](DA_1.html) (∥ [DN 14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14){: target="_blank"}) [T 1.1b12]

A group of monks gather to discuss Dharma after their meal and discuss the Buddha’s knowledge of buddhas that have existed in the past. They wonder if he knows about them through his own knowledge or because gods tell him. The Buddha overhears their conversation and joins them, giving a lengthy discourse about six buddhas who proceeded him in the distant past. He also gives a second discourse outlining the life of the Buddha Vipaśyin, which is essentially the same as the tradition story of Gautama’s early life and awakening. Finally, the Buddha relates how the Śuddhāvāsa gods, being former disciples of buddhas, have also told him about the buddhas of the past.
