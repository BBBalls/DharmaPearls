## 1. The Great Legend
### Introduction

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was in Śrāvastī at the Flowering Grove Hut of Jeta’s Grove.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the monks gathered in the Flowering Grove Hall after soliciting alms.[\[3\]](#n3){:#ref3} They engaged in a discussion with each other: “You monks, only the unsurpassed sage is so extraordinary! His miraculous powers are far-reaching, and his authority is tremendous. He has come to know the countless buddhas of the past who have entered nirvāṇa, broken the bonds, and eliminated speculation.
{:#p2}

3\. “He also knows how many eons ago those buddhas existed as well as their names, surnames, birth castes, the meals they had, the length of their lives, and what suffering and happiness they experienced.
{:#p3}

4\. “He also knows that those buddhas possessed such precepts, such principles, such wisdom, such liberation, and such abodes.”
{:#p4}

5\. “What do you think? Does the Tathāgata know this by discerning well the nature of things, or does he know these things because the gods come and tell him?”
{:#p5}

6\. The Bhagavān was in a quiet place at the time and clearly overheard the monks having that discussion with his heavenly ear. He rose from his seat, went to the Flowering Grove Hall, prepared a seat, and sat down.
{:#p6}

7\. Knowing the answer, the Bhagavān asked them, “Monks, what have you been discussing after gathering here?” The monks then related to him what it had been.
{:#p7}

8\. The Bhagavān told the monks, “Good, good! With complete faith, you’ve left home to cultivate the path, and you practice as you should. All of you have two types of conduct: The first is noble discussion of the teaching, and the second is noble silence. This discussion of yours is as it should be. The Tathāgata’s miraculous powers and authority are tremendous. He entirely knows the events of countless eons in the past. He knows it because he understands well the nature of things and because the gods come and tell him.”
{:#p8}

9\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p9}

* {:.verse}“Monks gathered in the Dharma hall\\
To have a noble discussion;\\
In a quiet place, the Tathāgata\\
Heard it all with his heavenly ear.

* {:.verse}The Buddha’s sunlight shines everywhere\\
As he discerns the Dharma sphere’s meaning.\\
He also knows the past events\\
Of fully awakened ones and their complete nirvāṇa.

* {:.verse}Their names, surnames, and castes,\\
The births they received, he knows, too.\\
The places where they lived,\\
He sees them all with clear vision.

* {:.verse}Gods of great authority,\\
So handsome and dignified,\\
Also come and tell me about\\
Fully awakened ones and their complete nirvāṇa.

* {:.verse}Recounting their births, names, and surnames,\\
With a kalaviṅka voice, fully knowing them,[\[4\]](#n4){:#ref4}\\
The unsurpassed lord of gods\\
Describes the buddhas of the past.”

### The Seven Buddhas

10\. He also told the monks, “Would you like to hear about the circumstances of the buddhas in the past? The Tathāgata knows them with the knowledge of past lives. I’ll tell you about them.”
{:#p10}

The monks said to him, “Bhagavān, now would be a good time for it!” “We’d be glad to hear it!” “Excellent, Bhagavān!” “Once the discourse is complete, we’ll approve of it!”

11\. The Buddha told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well! I’ll discern and explain it for you.” The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.
{:#p11}

12\. The Buddha told the monks, “Ninety-one eons ago, there was a buddha in the world named Vipaśyin. He was a tathāgata, an arhat, who arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, thirty-one eons ago, there was a buddha named Śikhin. He was a tathāgata, an arhat, who arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, thirty-one eons ago, there was a buddha named Viśvabhū. He was a tathāgata, an arhat, who arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, during the present eon of fortune, there was a buddha named Krakucchanda. He was a tathāgata, an arhat, who arose in the world. Another was named Kanakamuni, and another was named Kāśyapa. Now, I’ve also achieved the supreme and perfect awakening during this present eon of fortune.”
{:#p12}

13\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p13}

* {:.verse}“Ninety-one eons ago,\\
There was the Buddha Vipaśyin.\\
Next, thirty-one eons ago,\\
There was the buddha named Śikhin.

* {:.verse}During that same eon,\\
The Tathāgata Viśvabhū arose.\\
During the present eon of fortune,\\
There’ve been countless millions of years.

* {:.verse}There were four great sages\\
Who arose because of their pity for beings:\\
Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni,\\
Kāśyapa, and Śākyamuni.

14\. “You should know that during the time of Buddha Vipaśyin, people lived for 80,000 years. During the time of Buddha Śikhin, people lived for 70,000 years. During the time of Buddha Viśvabhū, people lived for 60,000 years. During the time of Buddha Krakucchanda, people lived for 40,000 years. During the time of Buddha Kanakamuni, people lived for 30,000 years. During the time of Buddha Kāśyapa, people lived for 20,000 years. In the present time that I’ve arisen in the world, few people live more than a hundred years, and many live for less.”
{:#p14}

15\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p15}

People lived for 30,000 years.\\
During the time of Buddha Kāśyapa,\\
People lived for 20,000 years.

* {:.verse}Now during my time,\\
People live not more than a hundred.”

16\. “Buddha Vipaśyin arose from the warrior caste, and his clan was Kauṇḍinya. Buddha Śikhin and Buddha Viśvabhū were from the same caste and clan. Buddha Krakucchanda arose from the priestly caste, and his clan was Kāśyapa. Buddha Kanakamuni and Buddha Kāśyapa were from the same caste and clan. Now, I’m a tathāgata, an arhat, who arose from the warrior caste, and my clan is Gautama.”
{:#p16}

17\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p17}

* {:.verse}“The Tathāgatas Vipaśyin,\\
Śikhin, and Viśvabhū\\
Were three perfectly awakened ones\\
Who arose from the Kauṇḍinya clan.\\
The next three tathāgatas\\
Arose from the Kāśyapa clan.

* {:.verse}Now, I, the unsurpassed lord,\\
The trainer of sentient beings,\\
And supreme among gods and humans,\\
Am from the courageous Gautama clan.

* {:.verse}The first three perfectly awakened ones\\
Arose from the warrior caste,\\
And the next three tathāgatas\\
Arose from the priestly caste.\\
Now, I’m the unsurpassed lord\\
With the courage to arise from the warriors.”

18\. “Buddha Vipaśyin sat under a pippala tree and achieved the supreme and perfect awakening. Buddha Śikhin sat under a puṇḍarīka tree and achieved the supreme and perfect awakening. Buddha Viśvabhū sat under a sāla tree and achieved the supreme and perfect awakening. Buddha Krakucchanda sat under a śirṣa tree and achieved the supreme and perfect awakening. Buddha Kanakamuni sat under an udumbara tree and achieved the supreme and perfect awakening. Buddha Kāśyapa sat under a nyagrodha tree and achieved the supreme and perfect awakening. Now, I am a tathāgata, an arhat, who sat under a ’pattha tree and achieved the supreme and perfect awakening.”[\[5\]](#n5){:#ref5}
{:#p18}

19\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p19}

* {:.verse}“The Tathāgata Vipaśyin\\
Went to a pippala tree.\\
He made it his abode\\
And achieved supreme and perfect awakening.

* {:.verse}Śikhin’s was a puṇḍarīka tree where he\\
Awakened and destroyed the source of existence.

* {:.verse}The Tathāgata Viśvabhū\\
Sat under a sāla tree.\\
When he knew and saw liberation,\\
His miraculous abilities had no hindrance.

* {:.verse}The Tathāgata Krakucchanda\\
Sat under a śirṣa tree.\\
He purified knowledge of everything;\\
He was undefiled and attached to nothing.

* {:.verse}Kanakamuni\\
Sat under an udumbara tree.\\
He made it has dwelling place\\
And destroyed cravings and anguish.

* {:.verse}Tathāgata Kāśyapa sat\\
Under a nyagrodha tree.\\
He made it his dwelling place\\
And eradicated the root of existences.

* {:.verse}Now, I’m Śākyamuni\\
Who sat at a ’pattha tree.\\
A tathāgata, a ten-powered sage\\
Who eradicated the bonds.\\
I crushed the army of Māra,\\
And explained great insight to the assembly.

* {:.verse}These seven buddhas with the power of effort\\
Radiated light and dispelled darkness.\\
They each sat at trees\\
Where they achieved the perfect awakening.”

20\. “Tathāgata Vipaśyin taught Dharma to three congregations. The first congregation had 168,000 disciples. The second congregation had 100,000 disciples. The third congregation had 80,000 disciples. Tathāgata Śikhin taught Dharma to three congregations. The first congregation had 100,000 disciples. The second congregation had 80,000 disciples.

{:#p41}

### The Buddha Vipaśyin
#### The Bodhisattva’s Birth

43\. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Now, I’d like to give a talk on the events of past Buddhas using the knowledge of past lives. Would you like to hear it?”
{:#p43}

The monks replied, “Now is the right time. We’d be glad to hear it!”

44\. The Buddha told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely and consider it well! I will give you a discerning explanation.
{:#p44}

45\. “Monks, you should know the way it always is with buddhas. When Bodhisattva Vipaśyin’s spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb and entered through her right side, he was properly mindful and undisturbed.
{:#p45}

46\. “At that moment, there was an earthquake, and a great radiance illuminated the whole world. The sun and moon couldn’t compare to its brilliance. Sentient beings in complete darkness saw each other and recognized where they were going. When this light illuminated Māra’s palace, and the gods, Śakra, Brahmā, ascetics, priests, and other sentient beings were all outshined by that great radiance, the light of those gods naturally disappeared.”
{:#p46}

47\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p47}

* {:.verse}“Thick banks of clouds in the sky\\
Illuminate the earth with lightning.\\
Vipaśyin descended into a womb,\\
And his illuminating light was likewise.

* {:.verse}The sun and moon couldn’t compare,\\
No light wasn’t outshined by it.\\
He dwelled in her womb, pure and undefiled:\\
This is the way it is with buddhas.

48\. “Monks, you should know the way it always is with buddhas. While he was in his mother’s womb, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin was focused and undisturbed. There were four gods armed with spears who stood guard over his mother so that neither humans nor non-humans could harm her. This is the way it always is.”
{:#p48}

49\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p49}

* {:.verse}“Four gods in four directions,\\
They were famous and dignified.\\
The Lord of Gods Śakra sent them\\
To guard the Bodhisattva well.

* {:.verse}Always armed with spears,\\
They never left their guard posts.\\
Humans and non-humans did no harm;\\
This is the way it always is with buddhas.

* {:.verse}Gods and spirits kept her protected\\
Like goddesses protecting a god.\\
His followers felt joyous;\\
This is the way it always is with buddhas.”

50\. He also told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When Bodhisattva Vipaśyin’s spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb, he was focused and undisturbed. His mother’s body was relaxed, she didn’t have any kind of illness, and her wisdom improved. His mother looked into her womb and saw the Bodhisattva’s body with fully formed faculties. It was the color of purple gold and without any blemish. She was like a man with eyesight seeing a pure beryl that’s transparent and lacks any obstructions to his vision. Monks, this is the way it always is with buddhas.”
{:#p50}

51\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p51}

* {:.verse}“He was like a pure beryl gemstone\\
That’s bright like the sun and moon.\\
That gentle sage dwelled in his mother’s womb,\\
And his mother had no illness.

* {:.verse}Her wisdom was improved,\\
And she saw her fetus like a golden statue.\\
His mother’s pregnancy was comfortable;\\
This is the way it always is with buddhas.”

52\. The Buddha told the monks, “[This is the way it always is with buddhas.] When Bodhisattva Vipaśyin’s spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb, he was focused and undisturbed. His mother’s heart was pure, without any notions of desire. Nor was she burned by the fire of lust. This is the way it always is with buddhas.”
{:#p52}

53\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p53}

* {:.verse}“The Bodhisattva in his mother’s womb\\
Had achieved the merit of a god in heaven.\\
His mother’s mind was pure;\\
She didn’t have any notions of desire.

* {:.verse}She abandoned lustful desires,\\
Neither defiled by nor going near them.\\
She wasn’t burned by the fire of desire;\\
The mothers of buddhas are always pure.”

54\. The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When Bodhisattva Vipaśyin’s spirit descended from the Tuṣita Heaven to his mother’s womb, he was focused and unconfused. His mother upheld the five precepts, purified the religious practice, and was faithful and loving. These virtues being accomplished, she was happy and fearless. When her body broke up and her life ended, she was born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”
{:#p54}

55\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p55}

* {:.verse}“The woman who’s pregnant with the sage\\
Makes effort and perfects the precepts.\\
Afterward, she surely receives a heavenly body;\\
This is the reason she’s called a ‘buddha mother.’”

56\. The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side. There was an earthquake, and a radiance illuminated [the whole world]. Just as when he first entered her womb, there wasn’t any dark place that wasn’t illuminated. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”
{:#p56}

57\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p57}

* {:.verse}“When the prince was born, the earth shook,\\
And a great light shined everywhere:\\
In this world and other worlds,\\
Above, below, and in all directions.

* {:.verse}He emitted a light that granted pure sight\\
Of his fully formed heavenly body.\\
With joyous and pure voices,\\
The Bodhisattva’s name was announced.”

58\. The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. The Bodhisattva’s mother held onto a tree limb, neither sitting nor lying down. Four gods stood in front his mother and presented fragrant water. They said, ‘Indeed, heavenly mother! Now you’ve given birth to a holy son. Don’t feel anguish over it!’ This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”
{:#p58}

59\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p59}

* {:.verse}“A Buddha’s mother doesn’t sit or lie down,\\
She stands in precepts, and cultivates the religious life.\\
Giving birth to the sage, she’s not indolent;\\
Gods and humans offer their help.”

60\. The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. His body was clean, not being sullied by filth. It was like a man with eyesight putting a pure, bright jewel on white silk, and neither of them dirties the other because they are both pure. The Bodhisattva emerged from the womb in the same way. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”
{:#p60}

61\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p61}

* {:.verse}“He was like a pure and bright jewel\\
That isn’t defiled when placed on silk.\\
When he emerges from the womb,\\
The Bodhisattva was clean and undefiled.”

62\. The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. Upon emerging from her right side, he fell to the ground and walked seven paces without anyone helping him. He looked all around in the four directions, raised his hand, and said, ‘Only I am exalted by both heaven and earth, for I will save sentient beings from birth, old age, illness, and death.’ This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”
{:#p62}

63\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p63}

* {:.verse}He was like a lion taking a step\\
And looking all around in the four directions.\\
He fell to the ground and walked seven paces,\\
Like a lion among humans.

* {:.verse}He also walked like a great nāga, \\
Looking all around in the four directions.\\
He fell to the ground and walked seven paces,\\
Like a nāga among humans.

* {:.verse}When the most exalted of bipeds was born,\\
He walked seven paces, steady on his feet;\\
Looking in the four directions, he raised his voice:\\
‘I will end the suffering of birth and death.’

* {:.verse}When he was first born,\\
He was equal to the unequalled.\\
He himself saw the root of birth and death,\\
And that body was his very last.”

64\. The Buddha told the monks, “This is the way it always is with buddhas. When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin emerged from his mother’s right side, and he was focused and undisturbed. Two streams of water sprung forth, one hot and one cold, which were provided to bathe him. This is the way it always is [with buddhas].”
{:#p64}

65\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p65}

* {:.verse}“When the most exalted of bipeds was born,\\
Two streams of water sprung forth.\\
They were provided for the Bodhisattva\\
To cleanse and purify his universal vision.

* {:.verse}Two streams sprung forth,\\
And their water was extremely pure.\\
One was hot, and the other was cold,\\
In which the Omniscient One was bathed.

### The Thirty-Two Signs

66\. “When the prince was first born, his father, king Bandhumat, summoned a group of physiognomists and fortune-tellers to examine him and determine his [future] fortune or misfortune.
{:#p66}

67\. “The physiognomists accepted his command and examined the prince. Lifting his robe, they saw he had the full set of signs. The fortune-tellers said, ‘Someone possessing these signs will have one of two destinies, without a doubt. If he remains at home, he’ll become a noble wheel-turning king. He’ll be the king of the four continents, and his four armies will be complete. He’ll rule with the correct Dharma without any wickedness, and he’ll be a blessing to the world. The seven treasures will come naturally to him. He’ll have a thousand courageous sons who defeat foreign adversaries, and there’ll be a great peace under heaven without the use of weapons. If he leaves home, he’ll achieve perfect awakening and be given the ten epithets.’
{:#p67}

68\. “The physiognomists then said to the king, ‘This son born to the king has thirty-two signs. He’ll have one of two destinies, without a doubt. If he stays at home, he’ll become a noble wheel-turning king. If he leaves home, he’ll achieve perfect awakening and be given the ten epithets.’”
{:#p68}

69\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p69}

* {:.verse}“The prince was born with a hundred merits\\
That the physiognomists foretold.\\
Like reading from a book they carried, [they said:]\\
‘He has one of two destinies, without doubt.

* {:.verse}If he enjoys the home life,\\
He’ll become a wheel-turning king.\\
Seven treasures that are hard to get\\
Will naturally come and make him a king.

* {:.verse}The gold wheel is replete with a thousand spokes\\
That hold a golden rim all around them.\\
It turns and flies wherever he travels;\\
Therefore, it’s called the heavenly wheel.

* {:.verse}Well-trained and standing with seven tusks,\\
Tall, broad, and white as snow,\\
And able to flying through the sky:\\
This is called the second elephant treasure.

* {:.verse}A horse travels all over the world,\\
Leaving in morning and returning to eat at sunset.\\
With a red mane and a peacock’s throat,\\
It’s called the third treasure.

* {:.verse}A pure beryl gemstone,\\
With a glow that illuminates a yojana\\
And lights up the night like it’s daytime:\\
That’s called the fourth treasure.

* {:.verse}With form, sound, fragrance, flavor, and touch\\
That’s unequalled by anyone else,\\
She is the best of women\\
Who’s called the fifth treasure.

* {:.verse}He presents beryl treasures to the king,\\
Jewels and myriad valuables, too.\\
Delighted to offer this tribute,\\
[The householder] is called the sixth treasure.

* {:.verse}As the wheel-turning king wishes,\\
His army quickly comes and goes.\\
Strong and swift, they do what the king wills,\\
And [their general is] called the seventh treasure.

* {:.verse}These are called the seven treasures:\\
The wheel, elephant, and horse pure white,\\
Householder, jewel, and woman treasures,\\
And the general treasure makes seven.

* {:.verse}He’ll look on them without tire\\
And enjoy himself with the five desires.\\
Like an elephant that breaks its bonds,\\
He’ll leave home to achieve perfect awakening.

* {:.verse}The king has such a son,\\
Exalted among two-legged beings.\\
In the world, he’ll turn the Dharma wheel,\\
Awakening he’ll achieved without negligence.’

70\. “His father the king repeated himself three times, asking the physiognomists, ‘Look again at the prince’s thirty-two signs. What are they called?’
{:#p70}

“The physiognomists lifted the prince’s robe and described his thirty-two signs: ‘First, his feet are flat. The soles of his feet are level and full, and they step on the ground comfortably. Second, the wheel sign is on the soles of his feet. Complete with a thousand spokes, they shine with many lights. Third, his hands and feet are webbed like the king of geese. Fourth, his hands and feet are soft like heavenly cloth. Fifth, his fingers and toes are unmatched in slenderness and length. Sixth, his heels are so full one never tires of looking at them. Seventh, his calves are straight up and down like a deer’s legs. Eighth, his bones are a chain, their joints hooking together like chain links. Ninth, his organ is hidden like that of a horse. Tenth, his hands hang lower than his knees. Eleventh, each of his pores has a hair growing from it, the hair curls to the right, and it’s the color of a dark blue beryl. Twelfth, his hairs curl to the right, are blue in color, and turn upward. Thirteenth, his body is gold-colored. Fourteenth, his skin is fine and soft, and dirt doesn’t stick to it. Fifteenth, his shoulders are even, full, rounded, and attractive. Sixteenth, he has the svastika symbol on his chest. Seventeenth, his body is twice as long as a human. Eighteenth, his seven points are equally full. Nineteenth, his body’s length and breadth is like that of a nyagrodha tree. Twentieth, he has rounded cheeks like a lion. Twenty-first, his breast is dignified like that of a lion. Twenty-second, he has forty teeth in his mouth. Twenty-third, he is dignified and symmetrical. Twenty-fourth, the gaps between his teeth are hidden. Twenty-fifth, his teeth are pure white and bright. Twenty-sixth, his throat is clean, and whatever flavored food he eats is always agreeable. Twenty-seventh, his tongue is so long and broad, it can lick his left or right ear. Twenty-eighth, his Brahmā voice is clear. Twenty-ninth, his eyes are deep blue. Thirtieth, he has eyes like a bull king that blink together, up and down. Thirty-first, he has a white tuft of soft and shiny hair between his brows. It’s a fathom long when pulled taut, and it curls to the right like a jewel when released. Thirty-second, he has a fleshy knot on his crown. These are the thirty-two signs.’”

71\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p71}

* {:.verse}“He stood well on soft feet\\
That didn’t leave footprints on the ground.\\
They were adorned with the thousand-spoked signs,\\
All of which were lustrous.

* {:.verse}He was like a nyagrodha tree\\
In circumference, straightness, and evenness.\\
The Tathāgata was unprecedented,\\
Whose organ was hidden like that of a horse.

* {:.verse}His body was adorned with golden jewels\\
As his many signs reflected each other.\\
Though he traveled conventionally,\\
Neither dust nor earth dirtied him.

* {:.verse}His heavenly form was so soft and gentle,\\
A heavenly parasol naturally shaded him.\\
His Brahmā voice and purple-gold body\\
Were like a lotus when it first emerges from water.

* {:.verse}The king asked the physiognomists,\\
And they respectfully answered him.\\
They praised the Bodhisattva’s signs,\\
As his whole body was glowing.\\
His hands, feet, limbs, and joints,\\
His center and extremities were all apparent.

* {:.verse}The flavor of his food was always perfect,\\
And his body was straight and not crooked.\\
The wheels on the soles of his feet were clear,\\
And his voice was like a kalaviṅka bird.

* {:.verse}The shape of his thighs was full,\\
Formed by his past actions.\\
His arms were full and well-rounded,\\
And his eyebrows were quite dignified.

* {:.verse}He was an exalted lion among humans,\\
His majestic power was supreme.\\
His rounded cheeks were dignified,\\
And he lay on his side like a lion.

* {:.verse}His well-arranged teeth were forty,\\
And the gaps between them were hidden.\\
His Brahmā voice is unprecedented,\\
So [people] come from far and near.

* {:.verse}Standing straight and not leaning over,\\
Both his hands touched his knees.\\
His hair was even and soft,\\
And people honored his beautiful signs.

* {:.verse}Each pore had a hair growing from it;\\
His hands and feet had the sign of webbing.\\
He had a fleshy topknot and deep blue eyes,\\
Which both blinked up and down.

* {:.verse}Both his shoulders were full and well-rounded,\\
Completing his thirty-two signs.\\
His heels were neither high nor low;\\
His calves were straight and slender as deer legs.

* {:.verse}A god among gods had come to us\\
Like an elephant that broke its leg bonds.\\
He would free sentient beings from suffering\\
That dwell in birth, old age, illness, and death.

* {:.verse}Out of kindness and compassion,\\
He would teach the four truths.\\
With plain Dharma expressions and meaning,\\
He’ll prompt many offerings and utmost honors.”

#### The Bodhisattva’s Early Life

72\. The Buddha told the monks, “When he was born, Bodhisattva Vipaśyin was sheltered from cold, heat, wind, rain, and dust by gods in the sky who held white parasols and jeweled fans for him.”
{:#p72}

73\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p73}

* {:.verse}“Unprecedented among humans,\\
He was born the most exalted of bipeds.\\
The gods respected and supported him\\
By offering jeweled parasols and fans.

74\. “His father, the king, provided him with four nannies: The first fed him milk, the second bathed him, the third rubbed him with incense, and the fourth entertained him. They joyously nurtured him without any neglect.”
{:#p74}

75\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p75}

* {:.verse}“His nannies were kind and loving,\\
Entrusted to nurture the boy from birth.\\
One fed him milk, one bathed him,\\
Two applied incense and entertained him.\\
The fragrance was the world’s most superb\\
That the exalted of humans was rubbed with.

76\. “When he was a youth, the whole country’s men and women watched him without tire.”
{:#p76}

77\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p77}

* {:.verse}“He was respected and liked by people\\
Like a freshly-made gold statue.\\
Men and women clearly observed him,\\
And they watched him tirelessly.

78\. “While he was a youth, the whole country’s men and women would pass him around and hold him up as though they were looking at a jeweled flower.”
{:#p78}

79\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p79}

* {:.verse}“When the exalted of bipeds was born,\\
He was respected and loved by people.\\
They took turns holding him up\\
As though looking at a jeweled flower.

80\. “When he was born, the Bodhisattva’s eyes were unblinking like a Trāyastriṃśa god. He was named Vipaśyin because he didn’t blink.”
{:#p80}

81\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p81}

* {:.verse}“The god among gods didn’t blink\\
Just like a Trāyastriṃśa god.\\
Seeing a form, he rightly observed it;\\
Therefore, he was called Vipaśyin.

82\. “When he was born, the Bodhisattva’s voice was clear, gentle, and harmonious like the voice of a kalaviṅka bird.”
{:#p82}

83\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p83}

* {:.verse}“He was like the bird of the Himalayas\\
That drinks flower nectar and sings.\\
The most exalted of bipeds\\
Had a voice that was just as clear.

84\. “When he was born, the Bodhisattva’s vision could see clearly as far away as a yojana.”
{:#p84}

85\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p80}

* {:.verse}“As a result of practicing pure deeds,\\
He got the marvelous glow of a god.\\
The Bodhisattva’s eyes could see\\
At a range of a one yojana.

86\. “When he was born, the Bodhisattva grew up to adulthood and was educated in the way [of governing] in the royal hall. His favor reached the common people, and his reputation for virtue was heard far away.”
{:#p86}

87\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p87}

* {:.verse}“In the royal hall, that young man\\
Educated the world with the way.\\
He made a variety of decisions,\\
So he was called Vipaśyin.

* {:.verse}His pure knowledge was vast\\
And deep like the ocean.\\
He delighted the mass of beings\\
And improved their wisdom.

#### The Bodhisattva Leaves Home

88\. “At that point, the Bodhisattva wanted to go out sight-seeing, so he ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses to tour a forest park. Once the chariot and horses were ready, the driver returned and said, ‘Now is a good time.’ The prince then rode in the precious chariot to the scenic park. While they were on the road, they saw an elderly man. His hair was white, his teeth had fallen out, and his wrinkled body was bent. He walked wearily with a cane and was short of breath.
{:#p88}

89\. “The prince asked his aide, ‘What sort of man is that?’
{:#p89}

“He answered, ‘This is an old man.’

90\. “The prince also asked, ‘What is “old”?’
{:#p90}

“He answered, ‘Old age happens as the end of one’s life approaches. When there aren’t many years left, it’s called being old.’

91\. “The prince asked, ‘Will I be likewise? Will I not escape this hardship?’
{:#p91}

“He answered, ‘Yes, anyone born is sure to become old. It doesn’t matter if they are upper or lower class.’

92\. “The prince was disturbed and unhappy. He told his driver to turn the chariot around and go back to the palace. He silently thought to himself, ‘To think I’ll also have to suffer being old!’”
{:#p92}

93\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p93}

* {:.verse}“Seeing an old man, his life about to end,\\
Walking weakly with a cane,\\
The Bodhisattva thought to himself,\\
‘I’ve yet to escape from this hardship!’

94\. “His father, the king, asked the driver, ‘Did the prince enjoy his excursion?’
{:#p94}

“He answered, ‘He didn’t enjoy it.’

95\. “The king asked him why, and the driver replied, ‘We happened upon an old man on the road, which made him unhappy.’
{:#p90}

96\. “His father, the king, then thought silently to himself, ‘The physiognomists foretold that the prince would leave home, and now he isn’t happy. What can I do about it? I’ll devise a way to make him stay in the inner palace and entertain him with the five desires. He’ll be delighted, which will prevent him from leaving home!’ He then decorated the palace’s guest quarters and selected some maidens to entertain the prince.”
{:#p96}

97\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p97}

* {:.verse}“His father, the king, heard this said\\
And decorated the palace guest quarters.\\
He gave him more of the five desires,\\
To prevent the prince from leaving home.

98\. “After that time, the prince again ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses for an excursion, and they encountered a sick man on the road. His body was limp, and his belly was huge. His face and eyes were dark, and he was lying alone in his own waste without anyone looking after him. His illness was so painful that he couldn’t speak.
{:#p98}

99\. “The prince looked back at his driver and said, ‘What sort of man is that?’

“He answered, ‘That is a sick man.’
{:#p99}

100\. “The prince asked, ‘What is ‘sick’?’
{:#p100}

“He answered, ‘Sickness is being attacked by one of many diseases. When a person is still alive and hasn’t died yet, they are called sick.”

101\. “‘Will I be likewise? Haven’t I escape this hardship yet?’

“‘Yes, anyone born becomes sick. It doesn’t matter if they are upper or lower class.’
{:#p101}

102\. “The prince was disturbed and unhappy. He told the driver to turn the chariot around and return to the palace. He thought silently to himself, ‘To think I’ll also have to suffer being sick!’”
{:#p102}

103\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p103}

* {:.verse}“Seeing that man who’d been sick a long time,\\
whose appearance was wasting away,\\
The prince thought quietly to himself,\\
‘I’ve yet to escape from this hardship!’

104\. “His father, the king, again asked the driver, ‘Did the prince enjoy his excursion?’
{:#p104}

“He answered, ‘He didn’t enjoy it.’

105\. “The king asked him why, and the driver answered, ‘We happened upon a sick man on the road, and he wasn’t happy about it.’
{:#p105}

106\. “His father, the king thought, ‘The physiognomists foretold that the prince would leave home, and now he isn’t happy. What can I do about it? I’ll devise a way to improve his entertainment. He’ll be delighted, which will prevent him from leaving home!’ The king then decorated the palace guest quarters and selected maidens to entertain the prince.”
{:#p106}

107\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p107}

* {:.verse}“Sight, sound, odor, flavor, and touch,\\
Sublime and delightful were they,\\
A result of the Bodhisattva’s merits;\\
Therefore, he was entertained by them.

108\. “At another time, the prince ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses for an excursion, and they encountered a dead man on the road. Multi-colored banners were posted in front and behind his corpse, and his relatives and family were lamenting, crying as they took it out of the city. The prince again asked, ‘What sort of man is that?’
{:#p108}

“He answered, ‘That’s a dead man.’

109\. “‘What exactly is “dead”?’
{:#p109}

“‘Death is the end. Breath goes first, warmth goes next, and then the faculties decay. When a person dies, they go somewhere else and live in a separate family. Therefore, it’s called death.’

110\. “The prince also asked the driver, ‘Will I be likewise? Haven’t I escaped this trouble?’
{:#p110}

“He answered, ‘Yes, everyone born is sure to die. It doesn’t matter if they are upper or lower class.’

111\. “The prince was disturbed and unhappy. He told the driver to turn the chariot around and return to the palace. He silently thought, ‘To think I too will have to suffer this death!’”
{:#p111}

112\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p112}

* {:.verse}“When he first saw a dead person,\\
The prince knew they would be reborn.\\
He silently thought to himself,\\
‘I haven’t escaped this hardship yet!’

113\. “His father, the king, again asked the driver, ‘Did the prince enjoy his excursion?’
{:#p113}

“He answered, ‘He didn’t enjoy it.’

114\. “The king asked him why, and the driver answered, ‘We happened upon a dead man on the road, and he wasn’t happy about it.’
{:#p114}

115\. “His father, the king, thought, ‘The physiognomists foretold that the prince would leave home, and now he isn’t happy. What can I do about it? I’ll devise a way to improve his entertainment. He’ll be delighted, which will prevent him from leaving home!’ The king then decorated the palace guest quarters and selected maidens to entertain the prince.”
{:#p115}

116\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p116}

* {:.verse}“The young man was famous\\
And surrounded by many maidens.\\
He enjoyed the five desires,\\
Like that Lord of Gods, Śakra.

117\. “At another time, he ordered his driver to prepare a chariot and horses for an excursion, and they encountered an ascetic on the road. He wore Dharma clothes and carried a bowl, looking at the ground as he walked. The prince asked his driver, ‘What sort of man is that?’
{:#p117}

“His driver replied, ‘That is an ascetic.’

118\. “The prince also asked, ‘What is an ascetic?’
{:#p118}

“He answered, ‘An ascetic renounces loved ones, leaves home, and cultivates the path. He controls his faculties so that he isn’t defiled by external desires. He’s kind to everyone, and he doesn’t do any harm. When he encounters suffering, he isn’t saddened. When he meets with pleasure, he isn’t delighted. He’s accepting like the earth; therefore, he’s called an ascetic.’

119\. “The prince said, ‘Excellent! This is the path is that truly severs worldly ties. It’s subtle, pure, and clear. This is the only way to happiness.’ He then ordered his driver to pull the chariot over [beside the ascetic].
{:#p119}

120\. “The prince then asked the ascetic, ‘What’s the purpose of cutting off one’s hair and beard, putting on Dharma robes, and carrying a bowl?’
{:#p120}

“The ascetic replied, ‘A person leaves home wanting to train their mind, forever part with defilement, kindly nurture living things, and do no harm. They quiet their vain thoughts; their only work is the path.’

121\. “The prince said, ‘Excellent! This path is the truest!’ He immediately ordered his driver, ‘Take my precious clothes and carriage and return them to the King. I’m going to cut off my hair and beard, put on the three-piece Dharma robe, and leave home to cultivate the path. Why is that? I want to train my mind, discard defilement, and purify my life in order to seek the methods of the path.’
{:#p121}

122\. “Thereupon, the driver took the prince’s precious chariot and robes and returned them to his father, the king. Afterward, the prince cut off his hair and beard, put on the three-piece Dharma robe, and left home to cultivate the path.”
{:#p122}

123\. The Buddha told the monks, “When he saw the elderly man and the sick man, the prince recognized the suffering of the world. When he saw the dead man, his feelings of attraction to the world ceased. Then, he saw the ascetic and the vastness of the great awakening. He dismounted his precious chariot and walked away from bondage, step by step. This was how he genuinely left home, his genuine renunciation.
{:#p123}

#### The Bodhisattva Achieves Awakening

124\. “When the people of the country heard that the prince had cut off his hair and beard, put on a Dharma robe, carried a bowl, and left home to cultivate the path, they said to each other, ‘This path must be genuine for the prince to give up his position as the country’s heir. That’s a serious thing to discard!’ Eighty-four thousand people in the country went to the prince wanting to become his disciples and leave home to cultivate the path.”
{:#p124}

125\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p125}

* {:.verse}“The prince choose the profound teaching;\\
And those who heard about it left home with him.\\
Free of the prison of loved ones,\\
They had none of the various bonds.

126\. “The prince then accepted them as disciples, and they traveled together, giving teachings in various places. From town to town and country to country, he was paid respects everywhere with the four types of service and support. The Bodhisattva thought, ‘When I travel through these countries with a large assembly, the hustle and bustle of people isn’t right for me. When will I be free of these crowds of people? The genuine pursuit of the path is done in a secluded place; then, a person can fulfill their aspirations. In a quiet place, I could focus my efforts on cultivating the path.’
{:#p126}

127\. “He also thought, ‘Sentient beings are pitiable, always living in darkness and experiencing the physical frailties of birth, old age, illness, and death, that collection of myriad pains. Dying here, they’re born there, and they’re born here after dying there. As a result of this mass of suffering, they cycle around endlessly. When will I comprehend this mass of suffering and extinguish birth, old age, and death?’
{:#p127}

128\. “Again, he thought, ‘Where does birth and death come from? What’s the condition for their existence?’ He then wisely examined their source. Old age and death comes from birth. Birth is the condition for old age and death. Birth arises from existence. Existence is the condition for birth. Existence arises from clinging. Clinging is the condition for existence. Clinging arises from craving. Craving is the condition for clinging. Craving arises from feeling. Feeling is the condition for craving. Feeling arises from contact. Contact is the condition for feeling. Contact arises from the six senses. The six senses are the condition for contact. The six senses arise from name and form. Name and form are the condition for the six senses. Name and form arise from consciousness. Consciousness is the condition for name and form. Consciousness arises from volition. Volition is the condition for consciousness. Volition arises from ignorance. Ignorance is the condition for volition.
{:#p128}

129\. “‘From the condition of ignorance, there’s volition. Volition is the condition for consciousness. Consciousness is the condition for name and form. Name and form is the condition for the six senses. The six senses are the condition for contact. Contact is the condition for feeling. Feeling is the condition for craving. Craving is the condition for clinging. Clinging is the condition for existence. Existence is the condition for birth. Birth is the condition for old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, and anguish. This whole mass of suffering exists on the condition of birth. This is the formation of suffering.’
{:#p129}

130\. “When the Bodhisattva contemplated the formation of this mass of suffering, knowledge arose, vision arose, awakening arose, insight arose, comprehension arose, wisdom arose, and realization arose.
{:#p130}

131\. “The Bodhisattva contemplated this as well: ‘The absence of what would cause the absence of old age and death? The cessation of what would cause the cessation of old age and death?’
{:#p131}

132\. “He then wisely observed their origin: ‘Old age and death don’t exist when birth doesn’t exist. Old age and death cease when birth ceases. Birth doesn’t exist when existence doesn’t exist. Birth ceases when existence ceases. Existence doesn’t exist when clinging doesn’t exist. Existence ceases when clinging ceases. Clinging doesn’t exist when craving doesn’t exist. Clinging ceases when craving ceases. Craving doesn’t exist when feeling doesn’t exist. Craving ceases when feeling ceases. Feeling doesn’t exist when contact doesn’t exist. Feeling ceases when contact ceases. Contact doesn’t exist when the six senses don’t exist. Contact ceases when the six senses cease. The six senses don’t exist when name and form don’t exist. The six senses cease when name and form cease. Name and form don’t exist when consciousness doesn’t exist. Name and form cease when consciousness ceases. Consciousness doesn’t exist when volition doesn’t exist. Consciousness ceases when volition ceases. Volition doesn’t exist when ignorance doesn’t exist. Volition ceases when ignorance ceases.
{:#p132}

133\. “‘It’s because ignorance ceases that volition ceases. Consciousness ceases because volition ceases. Name and form cease because consciousness ceases. The six senses cease because name and form cease. Contact ceases because the six senses cease. Feeling ceases because contact ceases. Craving ceases because feeling ceases. Clinging ceases because craving ceases. Existence ceases because clinging ceases. Birth ceases because existence ceases. Old age, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble cease because birth ceases.’
{:#p133}

134\. When the Bodhisattva contemplated the cessation of this mass of suffering, knowledge arose, vision arose, awakening arose, insight arose, comprehension arose, wisdom arose, and realization arose.”
{:#p134}

135\. “The Bodhisattva observed these twelve causal conditions in forward and reverse order. When he truly knew and saw them, he rose from his seat and achieved the supreme, correct, and perfect awakening.”
{:#p135}

136\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p136}

* {:.verse}“I’ll explain this to the assembly;\\
All of you should listen well.\\
Past bodhisattvas observe\\
Principles never heard before.

* {:.verse}‘What’s the condition for old age and death?\\
What are causes for them to exist?’\\
Having thus correctly observed them,\\
He knew the roots of their arising.

* {:.verse}‘What condition is the root of birth?\\
What causes it to exist?’\\
Having thus contemplated it,\\
He knew that birth arises from existence.

* {:.verse}Clinging to this, clinging to that,\\
One cycles to further existences.\\
Therefore, the Tathāgata teaches\\
That clinging is the condition for existence.

* {:.verse}It’s like a pile of refuse\\
That the wind blows all around.\\
Thus, clinging causes clinging,\\
Which proliferates because of craving.

* {:.verse}Craving arises from feelings\\
And the snare of suffering takes root.\\
Conditioned by its defilement,\\
Pain and pleasure are associated with it.

* {:.verse}‘What condition is the root of feeling?\\
What causes feeling to exist?’\\
Having contemplated this,\\
He knew feeling arises from contact.

* {:.verse}‘What condition is the root of contact?\\
What causes contact to exist?’\\
Having contemplated this,\\
[He knew] contact arises from the six senses.

* {:.verse}‘What condition is the root of the six senses?\\
What causes the six senses to exist?’\\
Having contemplated this,\\
[He knew] six senses arise from name and form.

* {:.verse}‘What condition is the root of name and form?\\
What causes name and form to exist?’\\
Having contemplated this,\\
[He knew] name and form arise from consciousness.

* {:.verse}‘What condition is the root of consciousness?\\
What causes consciousness to exist?’\\
Having contemplated this,\\
He knew consciousness arises from volition.

* {:.verse}‘What condition is the root of volition?\\
What causes volition to exist?’\\
Having contemplated this,\\
He knew that volition arises from ignorance.

* {:.verse}Such causes and conditions\\
Are called the true meaning of causation.\\
Observing it with wisdom and skill,\\
One can see the root of dependent origination.

* {:.verse}Suffering is not a noble creation,\\
Nor does it exist without reason.\\
Therefore, the discomfort of change\\
Is what wise people eliminate.

* {:.verse}If ignorance completely ceases,\\
Then there’s no volition.\\
If there isn’t any volition,\\
Then there isn’t any consciousness, either.

* {:.verse}If consciousness forever ceases,\\
There isn’t any name and form.\\
When name and form have ceased,\\
Then there aren’t any senses.

* {:.verse}If the senses are forever ceased,\\
Then there isn’t any contact.\\
If contact is forever ceased,\\
Then there isn’t any feeling, either.

* {:.verse}If feeling is forever ceased,\\
Then there isn’t any craving.\\
If craving is forever ceased,\\
Then there isn’t any clinging, either.

* {:.verse}If clinging is forever ceased,\\
Then there isn’t any existence.\\
If existence is forever ceased,\\
Then there isn’t any birth, either.

* {:.verse}If birth is forever ceased,\\
There’s no old age, illness, or mass of suffering.\\
The complete and eternal end of this,\\
That’s what is taught by the wise.

* {:.verse}These twelve conditions are profound,\\
Hard to see, and hard to recognize.\\
Only a buddha can fully realize:\\
‘Depending on this, that exists or doesn’t exist.’

* {:.verse}If someone can examine this themselves,\\
Then they won’t have various feelings.\\
With a profound vision of dependent origination\\
They won’t seek teachers outside themselves.

* {:.verse}Regarding the aggregates, elements, and senses,\\
They’re secluded from desire and undefiled.\\
They’re worthy of all gifts\\
And grace their benefactors with pure rewards.

* {:.verse}Attaining four techniques of discernment,\\
They win the realization of certainty.\\
Able to free themselves from many bonds,\\
They sever them with carefulness.

* {:.verse}Form, feeling, conception, volition, and consciousness,\\
They are like a rotten, old cart.\\
Honestly examining this principle,\\
One achieves the correct and perfect awakening.

* {:.verse}Like a bird flying in the sky,\\
Following the wind east or west,\\
The Bodhisattva cut the many bonds;\\
He was like a light cloth waving in the breeze.

* {:.verse}Vipaśyin in quietude\\
Examined these things:\\
‘What’s the condition for old age and death to exist?\\
What would cause them to cease?’

* {:.verse}After he had examined this,\\
Pure wisdom arose in him.\\
He knew old age and death come from birth,\\
And old age and death cease when birth does.

#### Brahmā’s Request

137\. “When the Buddha Vipaśyin first achieved awakening, he often cultivated two contemplations: The contemplation of peace and the contemplation of escape.”
{:#p137}

138\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p138}

* {:.verse}“The Tathāgata, being equal to the unequalled,\\
Often cultivated two contemplations:\\
That of peace and that of escape.\\
The sage had crossed over to the other shore.

* {:.verse}His mind attained freedom,\\
Having severed the many bonds.\\
Climbing the mountain, he looked in all directions,\\
So he was called ‘Vipaśyin.’

* {:.verse}The light of great wisdom destroys darkness\\
Like illuminating oneself with a mirror.\\
He eliminated anguish for the world,\\
Ended the suffering of birth, old age, and death.

139\. “In a quiet place, Buddha Vipaśyin again had this thought: ‘Now, I’ve attained this unsurpassed teaching that’s profound, subtle, hard to understand, hard to see, calming, pure, known by the wise, and not within the reach of ordinary fools. This is because sentient beings acknowledge different things, have different views, accept different things, and have different trainings. Based on their different views, they each pursue what delights them and study their professions. They therefore can’t understand this profound dependent origination, but nirvāṇa’s end of craving is twice as hard to know. If I were to teach it, they surely wouldn’t understand, and I’d be troubled by it.’ After having this thought, he remained silent and didn’t go on to teach the Dharma.
{:#p139}

140\. “Knowing what the Buddha Vipaśyin was thinking, the Brahma King thought to himself, ‘Now, it’ll be very sad when this world is destroyed. Buddha Vipaśyin has attained knowledge of this profound and subtle teaching, but he doesn’t want to teach it!’ In the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, Brahma instantly came down from his Brahma Heaven palace to stand in front of the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet and withdrew to stand to one side.
{:#p140}

141\. “The Brahma King knelt on his right knee and saluted the Buddha with his palms together. He said, ‘Please, Bhagavān, use this time to teach the Dharma! These sentient beings today have weakened their defilements, their faculties are strong, they’re respectful, and they could be easily educated. Fearing the afterlife and having no salvation from misdeeds, they can desist from their evil ways and be born in good destinies.’
{:#p141}

142\. “That Buddha told the Brahma King, ‘So it is, so it is! It’s as you say, but I thought to myself in a quiet place, “The correct Dharma I’ve attained is profound and subtle. If I taught it to others, they surely wouldn’t understand, and I’d be troubled by it.” So, I’m silent, not wanting to teach the Dharma. I’ve gone through countless eons of hardship without quitting and cultivated the unsurpassed practice. Now, I’ve won this hard to get Dharma for the first time. If I taught it to lustful, hateful, and ignorant sentient beings, they’d surely not put it into practice. It would be pointless and wearisome. This teaching is subtle and contradicts the world. Sentient beings who are defiled by desire and benighted by foolishness can’t be confident about it. Brahma King, I observe this to be so. That’s why I’ve remained silent and don’t want to teach the Dharma.’
{:#p142}

143\. “The Brahma King repeated his encouragement three times in earnest: ‘Bhagavān, if the Dharma isn’t taught, then it’ll be very sad when the world is destroyed. Please, Bhagavān, take this time to expound it. Don’t let sentient beings fall to other destinies!’
{:#p143}

144\. “The Bhagavān listened to the Brahma King repeat this encouragement three times, and he then looked at the world with his buddha eye. Sentient beings had weakened their defilements, and their faculties were sharp and dull, so teaching them would be hard with some and easy with others. Those who easily accepted the teaching feared their misdeeds in the afterlife, so they could desist from their evil ways and be born in good destinies. They were like utpala flowers, padma flowers, kumuda flowers, and puṇḍarīka flowers. Whether they’re beginning to grow from the muck but haven’t emerged from the water, they’ve grown enough to emerged from the water, or they’ve emerged from the water but haven’t bloomed yet, they’d easily bloom when they didn’t have the water’s muck clinging to them. The world’s sentient beings were likewise.
{:#p144}

145\. “The Bhagavān told the Brahma King, ‘I do pity all of you. I will disclose the Dharma entrance to immortality now. This teaching is profound and subtle; it’s difficult to understand, but I will teach those who’ll believe, accept, and enjoy listening to it. I won’t teach those who’ll be troubled or gain nothing from it.’
{:#p145}

#### Turning the Dharma Wheel

146\. “When the Brahma King realized that that Buddha had accepted his request, he rejoiced and celebrated. Circling the Buddha three times, he bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet and instantly disappeared.
{:#p146}

147\. “Not long after he was gone, the Tathāgata then thought to himself, ‘Now, who will be the first people I teach the Dharma?’ Then he thought, ‘I’ll go to Bandhuvatī. The king’s son Tiṣya and the great minister’s son Khaṇḍa will be the first to whom I’ll reveal the Dharma entrance to immortality.’
{:#p147}

148\. “Thereupon, in the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, the Bhagavān instantly disappeared from that tree of awakening and went to the king’s deer preserve at Bandhuvatī. He prepared a seat there and sat down.”
{:#p148}

149\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p149}

* {:.verse}“He was like a lion in the forest,\\
Wandering wherever it wants.\\
That Buddha was likewise;\\
He traveled without obstacles.

150\. “The Buddha Vipaśyin addressed the park’s warden, ‘Please go to the city and tell the king’s son Tiṣya and the great minister’s son Khaṇḍa, “Did you know? The Buddha Vipaśyin is residing in the deer preserve. He would like to see you if it’s a good time for it.”’
{:#p150}

151\. “The park’s warden accepted this instruction and left. He went to those two men and told them both what the Buddha had said. When the two had heard this, then went to the Buddha, bowed their heads at his feet, and withdrew to sit to one side.
{:#p151}

152\. “The Buddha gradually taught them the Dharma, teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting them. He discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire was bad and impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. He praised escaping it as the most subtle, pure, and supreme thing.
{:#p152}

153\. “The Bhagavān then saw that those two men’s minds were softened, joyous, confident, and ready to accept the correct teaching. He taught them the noble truth of suffering, expounding and disclosing it. He discerned and interpreted the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of escaping suffering.
{:#p153}

154\. “The king’s son Tiṣya and the great minister Khaṇḍa became removed from dust and free of defilement right there on their seats, and their vision of the Dharma was purified. They were like a white cloth that readily accepts a dye.
{:#p150}

155\. “At that moment, the spirit of the earth announced: ‘In the deer preserve of Bandhuvatī, the Tathāgata Vipaśyin has turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel that couldn’t be turned by ascetics or priests, gods such as Māra and Brahma, or any other worldly person.’ Thus, it made the rounds. The voice was clearly heard by the four god kings … the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods. In an instant, the voice reached the Brahma gods.”
{:#p155}

156\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p156}

* {:.verse}“Rejoicing and celebrating,\\
The gods praised the Tathāgata:\\
‘Vipaśyin became a Buddha\\
And turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel!’

* {:.verse}First rising from the king of trees,\\
He went to Bandhuvatī.\\
For Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel of four truths.

* {:.verse}After Khaṇḍa and Tiṣya\\
Accepted the Buddha’s teaching, they converted.\\
From that pure Dharma wheel,\\
There was nothing higher than the religious life.

* {:.verse}The host of the Trāyastriṃśa gods\\
And the Lord of Gods, Śakra,\\
Rejoiced at its turning and said,\\
‘There’s no god who hasn’t heard:

* {:.verse}“A buddha has arisen in the world\\
And turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel!”\\
The host of gods will increase,\\
And those asuras will diminish!’

* {:.verse}Up his name went to be heard everywhere,\\
His skillful wisdom left the limits of the world.\\
Having been freed in teachings,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}Observing the equal teaching,\\
His calmed heart was unpolluted.\\
Free from the yoke of birth and death,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}To cease pain and part with many evils,\\
He escaped desire and attained freedom.\\
Having left the prison of loved ones,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}Being rightly awakened, a sage among humans,\\
Exalted among bipeds, and a trainer,\\
He freed himself from all bonds\\
And turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}He was a teacher and skilled guide\\
Who vanquished the Māra foe.\\
Having departed from all evils,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}His uncontaminated power defeated Māra,\\
His faculties were focused and not neglectful.\\
Contamination ended, Māra’s bonds gone,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}When he learned the certain principle,\\
He knew that all things are not self.\\
This is the best of principles with which\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}He didn’t do it for profit or support,\\
Nor was he looking for renown.\\
It was out of pity for other sentient beings\\
That he turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}He saw pain and disaster of sentient beings,\\
Being oppressed by old age, illness, and death.\\
Because of these three bad destinies\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}He severed greed, anger, and delusion\\
And pulled up the root of craving.\\
Immovable and liberated,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}He’d won the hard victory over himself;\\
After that, he’d mastered himself.\\
Having won that and the hard victory over Māra,\\
He turned the Dharma wheel with wisdom.

* {:.verse}This unsurpassed Dharma wheel\\
Can only be turned by a Buddha.\\
Gods like Māra, Śakra, and Brahma\\
Are incapable of setting it in motion.

* {:.verse}Being near when the Dharma wheel turns\\
Is a blessing to the host of gods and humans.\\
The teacher of these gods and humans\\
Discovered the way to cross to the other shore.

#### Vipaśyin’s First Congregation

157\. “At that point, prince Tiṣya and the great minister’s son Khaṇḍa saw the Dharma and obtained its fruit truly and without pretense, and they achieved fearlessness. They then said to Buddha Vipaśyin, ‘We want to cultivate the pure religious practice of the Tathāgata’s teaching!’
{:#p157}

158\. “The Buddha said, ‘Welcome, monks! My Dharma is pure and free. Cultivating it will bring an end to suffering.’
{:#p158}

159\. “Those two men then were given the complete precepts. They hadn’t had those precepts long before the Tathāgata taught them three subjects: 1. miraculous abilities, 2. observing others’ minds, and 3. admonishments. They then become uncontaminated, their minds were liberated, and their knowledge of birth and death was unobstructed.
{:#p159}

160\. “At the time, the city of Bandhuvatī was quite populous, and many heard about those two men who had left home to train on the path, put on Dharma robes, carried bowls, and purely cultivated the religious life. They said to each other, ‘That path must be genuine to make them both give up their stations of worldly prosperity. That’s a serious thing to discard!’
{:#p160}

161\. “In that city, there were 84,000 people who visited Buddha Vipaśyin in the deer preserve. They bowed their heads at his feet and withdrew to sit at one side. The Buddha gradually taught them the Dharma, teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting them. He discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire was bad and impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. He praised escaping it as the most subtle, pure, and supreme thing.
{:#p161}

162\. “The Bhagavān then saw that the minds of this great assembly were softened, joyous, confident, and ready to accept the correct teaching. He then taught them the noble truth of suffering, expounding and disclosing it. He discerned and interpreted the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of escaping suffering.
{:#p162}

163\. “Those 84,000 people then became removed from dust and free of defilement right there on their seats, and their vision of the Dharma was purified. They were like a white cloth that readily accepts a dye. They saw the Dharma and obtained its fruit truly and without pretense, and they achieved fearlessness. They said to the Buddha, ‘We want to cultivate the pure religious practice of the Tathāgata’s teaching.’
{:#p163}

164\. “The Buddha said, ‘Welcome, monks! My Dharma is pure and free. Cultivating it will bring an end to suffering.’
{:#p164}

165\. “Those 84,000 people then were given the complete precepts. They hadn’t had those precepts long before the Tathāgata taught them three subjects: 1. miraculous abilities, 2. observing others’ minds, and 3. admonishments. They then become uncontaminated, their minds were liberated, and their knowledge of birth and death was unobstructed.
{:#p165}

166\. “In the deer preserve, there were 84,000 people who heard that the Buddha had turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel that couldn’t be turned by ascetics or priests, gods such as Māra and Brahmā, or any other worldly person. They then went to Bandhuvatī to visit Buddha Vipaśyin. They bowed their heads at his feet and withdrew to sit to one side.”
{:#p166}

167\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p167}

* {:.verse}“As when saving someone whose head is on fire,\\
One looks quickly for a way to put it out.\\
Those people were likewise;\\
They went quickly to the Tathāgata.

168\. “The Buddha teaching them Dharma was likewise. Then, there were 168,000 people in Bandhuvatī who formed a great assembly of monks. The monks Tiṣya and Khaṇḍa rose up into the air over that great assembly, and fire and water sprung from their bodies. They demonstrated such miracles and then taught the subtle Dharma for the assembly.
{:#p168}

169\. “The Tathāgata then thought to himself, ‘Now, there’s a great assembly of 168,000 monks in this city. They ought to go traveling from place to place in pairs for six years. When they return to the city, I’ll teach them the complete precepts.’
{:#p169}

170\. “The Śuddhāvāsa gods then knew what the Tathāgata was thinking. In the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, they disappeared from their heavens and reappeared in front of the Bhagavān. They bowed their heads at his feet and withdrew to stand to one side. They instantly said to the Buddha, ‘So it is, Bhagavān! There’s indeed a great assembly of 168,000 monks in this city. They ought to go traveling from place to place in pairs for six years. When they return to the city, teach them the complete precepts. We will keep them safe and prevent anyone from taking advantage of them.’
{:#p170}

“When he heard what the gods said, the Tathāgata silently accepted it.

171\. “The Śuddhāvāsa gods saw the Buddha silently gave his consent. They bowed at the Buddha’s feet and instantly disappeared as they returned to their heavens above. Not long after they left, the Buddha told the monks, ‘Now, there’s a large assembly of monks in the city. You ought to each spread out to travel and teach. After six years, return and gather for the teaching of the precepts.’
{:#p171}

172\. “After accepting the Buddha’s teaching, the monks took their robes and bowls, bowed to the Buddha, and departed.”
{:#p172}

173\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p173}

* {:.verse}“That Buddha sent away his undisturbed assembly\\
Without desires or attachments of affection.\\
Majestic as garuḍa birds,\\
They were like cranes taking off from a lake.

174\. “After a year, the Śuddhāvāsa gods told the monks, ‘You’ve been traveling for a year. Five years are left. Know that after six years have passed, you are to return to the city for the teaching of precepts.’
{:#p174}

175\. “Thus, when the sixth year arrived, the gods again told them, ‘Six years have passed. You should return for the teaching of precepts.’
{:#p175}

176\. After hearing what the gods said, the monks gathered up their robes and bowls and returned to Bandhuvatī. They went to Buddha Vipaśyin in the deer preserve, bowed their heads at his feet, and withdrew to sit to one side.”
{:#p176}

177\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p177}

* {:.verse}“They were like well-trained elephants\\
That do whatever the handler wishes.\\
That great assembly was likewise;\\
They returned as they’d been instructed.

178\. “That Tathāgata then rose in the air above the great assembly in a cross-legged sitting posture and taught them the Precepts Sūtra. ‘Tolerance is supreme. The Buddha teaches that nirvāṇa is the highest. It’s not possible to become an ascetic by cut off one’s hair and beard and then harming others.’
{:#p170}

179\. “The Śuddhāvāsa gods weren’t far from the Buddha when he spoke these verses:
{:#p179}

* {:.verse}“‘The Tathāgata has great wisdom,\\
He’s sublime and uniquely venerable.\\
He perfected calm observation\\
And achieved the supreme, perfect awakening.

* {:.verse}For the masses of beings,\\
He achieved awakening in the world.\\
With the four genuine truths,\\
He taught his disciples.

* {:.verse}Suffering, suffering’s cause,\\
The truth of its cessation,\\
And the noble eightfold path\\
Arrive at the place of safety.

* {:.verse}The Buddha Vipaśyin\\
Appeared in the world.\\
Amidst a great assembly,\\
He’s as brilliant as the sun.’

“After he spoke these verses, they instantly disappeared.”

### The Śuddhāvāsa Gods

180\. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “I thought to myself, ‘Once when I was on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa at Rājagṛha, this thought occurred to me, “There’s nowhere I haven’t been born except for the Śuddhāvāsa heavens. If I were born in those heavens, I wouldn’t return to this world.”’
{:#p180}

181\. “Monks, I also had this thought: ‘I want to go up to the Avṛha Heaven.’ In the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, I disappeared from here and appeared in that heaven.
{:#p181}

182\. “When the gods there saw me arrive, they bowed their heads and stood to one side. They said to me, ‘We were disciples of the Tathāgata Vipaśyin. Having been taught by that Buddha, we were reborn here. We recite the history of that Buddha as well as that of Buddha Śikhin, Buddha Viśvabhū, Buddha Krakucchanda, Buddha Kanakamuni, Buddha Kāśyapa, and Buddha Śākyamuni. They were our teachers. Having been taught by them, we were reborn here.’
{:#p182}

183\. “They recited the history of buddhas when I was born in the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. It was the same there, too.”
{:#p183}

184\. The Buddha then spoke in verse:
{:#p184}

* {:.verse}“In the time it takes a strong man\\
To flex his arm for a moment,\\
I used my miraculous abilities\\
To go to the Avṛha Heaven.

* {:.verse}I was the seventh great sage\\
Who defeated the two Māras.\\
When the Atapa gods saw me, \\
They saluted and venerated me.

* {:.verse}Like the pārijāta tree,\\
The Śākya teacher was heard from afar.\\
With signs and excellencies replete,\\
I arrived in the Sudarśana Heaven.

* {:.verse}I was like a lotus flower\\
To which the muck doesn’t cling.\\
The Bhagavān was undefiled\\
When he arrived in the Mahāsudarśana Heaven.

* {:.verse}I was like the sun at daybreak,\\
Clear, without specks or blurriness.\\
Bright like the autumn moon,\\
I visited Akaniṣṭha one time.

* {:.verse}These are five dwelling places\\
Of purified sentient beings\\
Who’re Born there because of mental purity;\\
I visited those gods without affliction.

* {:.verse}Those of pure mind who arrive there\\
Were disciples of buddhas.\\
They discarded defiled clinging,\\
Were happy to cling to nothing.

* {:.verse}Seeing the Dharma with certainty,\\
They were disciples of Vipaśyin.\\
With pure minds, they were welcome\\
To visit the great sage of humans.

* {:.verse}The disciples of Buddha Śikhin\\
Were unsullied and unconditioned.\\
They came with pure minds\\
To visit the sage who left existence.

* {:.verse}The disciples of Viśvabhū\\
Were replete with faculties.\\
With pure minds, they visited me\\
Like the sun shining in the sky.

* {:.verse}The disciples of Krakucchanda\\
Had renounced their desires.\\
With pure minds, they visited me\\
Resplendent with sublime light.

* {:.verse}The disciples of Kanakamuni\\
Were unsullied and unconditioned.\\
With pure minds, they visited me\\
Their light like the full moon.

* {:.verse}The disciples of Kāśyapa\\
Were replete with faculties.\\
With pure minds, they visited me\\
As though praying to the northern sky.

* {:.verse}Those undisturbed great sages\\
With supreme miraculous abilities\\
And steadfast minds,\\
They were disciples of buddhas.

* {:.verse}Those with pure minds who came\\
Were disciples of buddhas.\\
They venerated the Tathāgata\\
And fully informed the sage of humans:

* {:.verse}Those born to achieve awakening,\\
Their names, surnames, and castes,\\
Who saw and knew the profound teaching\\
And achieved the supreme awakening.

* {:.verse}Monks in a quiet abode,\\
They were free of dust and defilement.\\
Earnest and not negligent,\\
They cut the bonds of existence.

* {:.verse}These were the buddhas,\\
Their histories from beginning to end.\\
The Tathāgata of the Śākyas\\
Has discoursed it.”

185\. After the Buddha had taught this Sūtra of the Great History, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1}This sutra is parallel to Pali [DN 14](https://suttacentral.net/dn14){: target="_blank"} and Chinese T2, T3, T4, T125 (48.4). There’s also a reconstructed Skt. text from Turfan that shows a close relationship with the present text. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}*Flowering Grove Hut*. Ch. 花林窟, G. *Karirakuti, P. Karerikuṭikā. The Chinese translation of this placename is in general agreement with P. Karerikuṭikā, which means Musk Rose Tree Hut. This placename is missing from the extant S. and the other Ch. translations, which only mention Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. The P. edition mentions both locations. [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3}*Flowering Grove Hall*. Ch. 花林堂, G. Kariramaṃḍalamaḍa, P. Karerimaṇḍalamāḷa, Skt. Karīrikamaṇḍalavāṭa. All editions except for T125 agree on the name of this place. In the present text, Skt. maṇḍalavāṭa has been translated simply as “hall,” which is likely a simplification by the Chinese translator given the existence of the placename in extant G. texts. Multiple sources agree that a maṇḍalavāṭa (lit. “circular garland”) was not a building but a circular area fenced off like a courtyard to serve as a sacred space in later Buddhist history. [\[back\]](#ref3)
4. {:#n4}*kalaviṅka*. Ch. 哀鸞. This is a Chinese translation (lit. “mourning phoenix.”) of kalaviṅka, which literally means something like  The kalaviṅka is a mythical bird that sits on mountain tops and sings gentle songs. Prosaically, it also refers to birds like the Indian cuckoo. [\[back\]](#ref4)
5. {:#n5}*’pattha tree*. Ch. 鉢多 (puat-ta). G. ?, P. assattha, S. aśvattha. 鉢多 is a well-known transliteration for S/G. pātra (“bowl”) but makes little sense here. Observing that S. aśva becomes aśpa in G., I can only speculate that the initial syllable aś- has been omitted, leaving us with -pattha. [\[back\]](#ref5)
