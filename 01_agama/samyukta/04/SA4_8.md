<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 386 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 549 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0104c18" target="_blank">T99.2.104c18-26</a>). It’s partially parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.71" target="_blank">AN 5.71</a>, and the next <em>sūtra</em>, which provides an explanation of the analogies for an <em>arhat</em> found here.

<li id="n2"><em>no barred gate, has leveled off the city moat, and has crossed the dangerous heights.</em> C. 無有關鍵，平治城壍，度諸嶮難. A similarly esoteric description of an <em>arhat</em> is found in AN 5.71. The next <em>sūtra</em> (<a href="SA4_9.html" target="_blank">SĀ 4.9</a>) will provide us with a commentary on what these analogies meant to this text’s tradition. See the notes there for a comparison with AN 5.71. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
