    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four noble truths. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.</td>

    <td id='p3'>3. “If a monk has known the noble truth of suffering, then he has understood [suffering] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s formation, then he has ended [its formation] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, then he has realized [its cessation] … has known the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation, then he has cultivated [that path]. In this way, a monk then ends craving and turns away from the bonds. Immediately understanding, he reaches the final end of suffering.”<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>

<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 383 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 546 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0104b20" target="_blank">T99.2.104b20-8</a>). [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Immediately understanding.</em> C. 於慢無明等. I’ve followed Yinshun’s suggestion to adopt the alternate reading that converts 無明等 to 無間等. 無間等 was the translation of P. <em>abhisamaya</em>, which appears to mean an epiphany or sudden realization. The C. trans. lit. means “immediacy,” which seems inadequate, so I’ve added “understanding” to that reading. It’s also questionable to me that 慢 belongs in the passage because it breaks the pattern of four characters per clause that classical Chinese generally follows, so I have left it out of my translation.<br/>
Uncorrected, the Taisho reads: “In this way, a monk ends craving, turns away from the bonds such as pride and ignorance, and reaches the final end of suffering.” [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
