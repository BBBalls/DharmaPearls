    <td id='p3'>3. “If a monk has known the noble truth of suffering, then he has understood [suffering] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s formation, then he has ended [its formation] … has known the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, then he has realized [its cessation] … has known the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation, then he has cultivated [that path]. In this way, that monk is called an <em>arhat</em>. His contaminants have ended, his task has been accomplished, he’s free of the heavy burdens, and he has won his own reward. Having ended the bonds of existence, he’s well liberated with right knowledge.”</td>
