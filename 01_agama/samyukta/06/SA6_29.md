It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If one is correctly disillusioned with, doesn’t enjoy, and abandons one thing, that is the ultimate end of suffering, and they will be freed from suffering.

When one becomes correctly disillusioned with, doesn’t enjoy, and abandons these ten things, that is the ultimate end of suffering, and they will be freed from suffering.”</td>
