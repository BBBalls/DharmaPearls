<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 206 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 257 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0052b20" target="_blank">T99.2.52b20-8</a>). It and the next <em>sūtra</em> are parallels of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.160" target="_blank">SN 35.160-161</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is closest to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.161" target="_blank">SN 35.161</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><p>This passage is essentially the same as the one we find in SN 35.161, but it has been developed further. The equivalent passage in Pali begins simply as: “Mendicants, meditate in retreat. For a mendicant who meditates in retreat, things become truly clear” (<em>… paṭisallāne, bhikkhave, yogamāpajjatha. Paṭisallīnassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno yathābhūtaṁ okkhāyati.</em>).</p>
<p>The C. passage has added phrases like “diligent in the methods” (勤方便, where 方便 probably translates an equivalent to P. <em>padhāna</em>, “make effort”). It also uses a general verb for meditation (禪思), while the phrase “inner peace of one’s mind” (內寂其心) adds a context more specific to the Buddhist practice of <em>dhyāna</em>. It seems plausible that 禪思 would translate a verb or past participle like S. <em>dhyāyati</em> (“to reflect, meditate, muse, contemplate”), but note that in SN 35.161, the parallel is P. <em>yogamāpajjatha</em>.</p>
<p>The C. also translates an equiv. of P. <em>okkhāyati</em> as 顯現 (“to manifest, make plain, appear”) but adds a verb to <em>yathābhūta</em> so that the expression becomes “truly know what appears” (如實知顯現). This doesn’t happen in SĀ 1.80, however, making is possible that the addition of 知 may be in error.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a good example of how we can see textual development of concise passages into more explicit and verbose expressions when comparing parallels. In this case, the Pali version is the simpler one. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
