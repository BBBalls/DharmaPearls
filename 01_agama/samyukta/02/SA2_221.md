<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 276 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 399 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0073c09" target="_blank">T99.2.73c9-5c17</a>). Its parallels are found in the <cite>Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya</cite> (T1442.23.792a17-794a17) and at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn146" target="_blank">MN 146</a>.</p>
<p>The <cite>Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya</cite> version is clearly the same <em>sūtra</em> as we find here in SĀ and provides a piece of evidence that SĀ is from the same canon. However, it also provides evidence of how Buddhist texts, even Āgama <em>sūtra</em>s, grew in size gradually through the addition of details and more verbose descriptions. The present text was translated ca. 440 CE, while the <cite>Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhikṣu Vinaya</cite> was translated ca. 700 CE. The latter was also translated from a Sanskritized original as evidenced by its transliterations, while SĀ was still in Prakrit.</p>
<p>When we compare this SĀ version to MN 146, we find that the Pali version is less verbose in terms of the background story but more so in terms of what Nandaka teaches the nuns. It, for instance, doesn’t include the backstory of the Buddha telling the monks to teach the nuns before the issue of Nanda refusing to take his turn arose. But when Nandaka teaches the selfless nature of the sense fields, he walks the nuns through a lengthier rationale that begins with their impermanence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, MN 146 only treats the inner and outer sense fields and six groups of awareness before moving on to the parables of the oil lamp, tree shadow, and butcher. The overall outline of MN 146 is more concise than SĀ 2.221, but it has been made more verbose and Nanda’s second teaching is not abbreviated away. The result is that it is a longer <em>sutta</em> than SĀ 2.221 in terms of total word count, but SĀ 2.221 has been expanded to cover additional topics more concisely.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, the content of these three versions are remarkably equiv., and we can clearly see that there was an original that hasn’t been changed drastically by any one of them. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>This list of names is reminescent of the disciple lists that became common in the introductions of later Buddhist scriptures, especially among Mahāyānists. It is not found in MN 146, but T1442 has a slightly larger list of nuns. Notes on each name can be found below:</p>
<p><em>Cundā</em>. C. <span class="ch">純陀</span> (EMC. tʃɪuĕn-da). This is a well-known translit. of P/S. <em>cunda</em>. Presumably, it was in a feminine form: Cundā. The parallel in T1442 is an alt. form of the same translit. (<span class="ch">准陀</span>, EMC. tʃɪuĕn-da).</p>
<p><em>Meṇḍikā</em>. C. <span class="ch">民陀</span> (EMC. miĕn-da). Meṇḍaka was the name of a prominent lay disciple of the Buddha. My tentative guess is that this was a feminine form of the same in Prakrit. Again, T1442 has the same translit.</p>
<p><em>Mārabhā</em>. C. <span class="ch">摩羅婆</span> (EMC. mua-la-bua). The <span class="ch">翻梵語</span> has an entry for <span class="ch">摩羅娑</span> immediately after the entry for <span class="ch">波羅遮羅</span> (the next name in this list), suggesting that <span class="ch">娑</span> was a typo for <span class="ch">婆</span>, which was fairly common for these two characters. The interpretation there reinforces this conclusion: <span class="ch">譯曰莫懶</span> (T2130.54.1002a16), which presumably describes <em>mā</em> (“no”) + <em>rabha</em> (“negligence”). The corresponding translit. in T1442 (<span class="ch">末臘婆</span>) also adds support for taking <span class="ch">娑</span> in <span class="ch">翻梵語</span> as a typo. Thus, I arrive at Mārabhā as this nun’s name.</p>
<p><em>Pālācārā</em>. C. <span class="ch">波羅遮羅</span> (EMC. pua-la-tʃɪă-la). The <span class="ch">翻梵語</span> says for this translit.: <span class="ch">譯曰波羅者守遮羅者行</span> (T2130.54.1002a15), which suggests <em>pāla</em> (<span class="ch">守</span>, “guard”) + <em>ācāra</em> (<span class="ch">行</span>, “conduct”). There was a nun in P. sources named Paṭācārā. The alternation between -ṭ- and -ḷ- in Indic dialects was not so uncommon, so I suspect this is the same nun. As an added bit of evidence, T1442 has a nun named “great robe” (<span class="ch">大衣</span>), which was an ironic name for the mendicant’s patchwork robes. A synonym for this could well be S. <em>paṭaccara</em> (“worn-out garment”), which is very similar in pronunciation to P. Paṭācārā. It would seem that this nun’s name has suffered some confusion as it traveled between Indic dialects. I have retained the Pr. version found in this text given the uncertainties.</p>
<p><em>Āḷavikā</em>. C. <span class="ch">阿羅毘迦</span> (EMC. •a-la-bii-kă). This was also the translit. of the monk Āḷavakā’s name found in the <cite>Sudarśana Vinaya Vibhāṣā</cite> (<span class="ch">善見律毘婆沙</span>, cf. T1462.24.764b16). His name was sometimes written Āḷavikā in P. sources. Buddhaghoṣa and the <span class="ch">善見律毘婆沙</span> both agree that he was named for the village where he was born. Buddhaghoṣa also says that all children born there were so named. The <span class="ch">翻梵語</span> has entries for this translit. at T2130.54.998b16 and 1002a17. It says: <span class="ch">阿羅毘迦 譯曰小語</span>. This suggests a word like S. <em>ālāpika</em>, which is also plausible. I’ve opted for the reading Āḷavikā here, especially since T1442 appears to include a translation of S. Aṭavī (<span class="ch">曠野</span>, “wilderness”), which is equiv. to Pr. Āḷavi, the name of the village.</p>
<p><em>Kṣemā</em>. C. <span class="ch">差摩</span> (EMC. ṭṣ‘ïĕ-mua). This was a well-known translit. of S. <em>kṣema</em> (P. <em>khema</em>), and Khemā was the name of a prominent nun in P. sources. T1442 lists a nun named “Security” (<span class="ch">安隱</span>) which matches the meaning of S. <em>kṣema</em>.</p>
<p><em>Namati</em>. C. <span class="ch">難摩</span> (EMC. nan-mua). This would translit. P/S. <em>nama-</em> or <em>nāma-</em>, and presumably a final syllable has been dropped. In G., there would have been no differentiation between these two possibilities because the language lacked long vowels. The final syllable, though, could have been <em>-da</em> or <em>-di</em>, which would transl. to S. <em>-ta</em> or <em>-ti</em>. My guess that the name was Namati is based on it being the name of a divinity. S. <em>namati</em> is a verb that means “bow” or “bend,” and S. <em>namada</em> is an adj. with meanings such as “crooked, master, felt, cloud.” It’s also not impossible that the C. is a corruption of Nandā, the name of a prominent nun in P. sources that was a common name for women in general.</p>
<p><em>Kṛśa Gautamī</em>. C. <span class="ch">吉離舍瞿曇彌</span> (EMC. kiĕt-lɪĕ-ʃɪă gɪu-dəm-miĕ), G. <em>*kiriṣa gotami</em>, P. <em>kisā gotamī</em>, S. <em>kṛśa gautamī</em>. The C. translit. matches the G. equiv. of this nun’s name, which means “the thin Gautamī,” though <em>kṛśa</em> is translated as “weak” (<span class="ch">少力</span>) in T1442. There is also an (apparent) error in T1442 that separated <em>Kṛśa</em> and <em>Gautamī</em> as two different names when they should be together as one.</p>
<p><em>Utpalāvarṇā</em>. C. <span class="ch">優鉢羅色</span> (EMC. ɪəu-puat-la + “color”), G. <em>upalavaṃna</em>, P. <em>uppalavaṇṇā</em>, S. <em>utpalāvarṇā</em>. The C. translit. of S. <em>utpala</em> is well-known. This was the blue lotus flower, so the meaning of this famous nun’s name is “color of the blue lotus.” T1442 translates her name fully as “color of a lotus flower” (<span class="ch">蓮花色</span>).</p>
<p><em>Mahāprajāpatī</em>. C. <span class="ch">摩訶波闍波提</span> (EMC. mua-ha-pua-ʒɪă-pua-dei), G. <em>mahapajapadi</em>, P. <em>mahāpajāpatī</em>, S. <em>mahāprajāpatī</em>. The C. translit. matches the G. pronunciation, though the difference is only in the final <em>-di</em> instead of <em>-tī</em>. T1442 translates this nun’s name as “Great Lord of the World” (<span class="ch">大世主</span>), interpreting Prajāpatī as the name of the Vedic creator god. She was the Buddha’s aunt and adoptive mother (being also married to his father) before becoming a nun. She was the leader of the early nun assembly after convincing the Buddha to allow women to ordain under his teaching. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>taught, instructed, edified, and gladdened … with a Dharma talk.</em> C. <span class="ch">說法，示、教、照、喜</span>, P. <em>dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṁsesi</em>. This expression with four verbs is found around a hundred times in other SĀ <em>sūtra</em>s. An alternate version that substitutes <span class="ch">利</span> (“to benefit”) for <span class="ch">照</span> (“to clearly understand”) occurs once in SĀ and many times in DĀ and the alternate Chinese SĀ (i.e., T100).</p>
<p>An equiv. expression in MĀ is a little more elaborate and quite frequent: “taught the Dharma for them, encouraging, inspiring, and making them glad in measureless ways” (<span class="ch">為彼說法，勸發渴仰，成就歡喜，無量方便</span>). It appears to only have the last three verbs that is found in the P. version.</p>
<p>Finally, EĀ also has a few instances of a simpler version: “gave a talk on the profound Dharma, encouraging, delighting, and making them glad.” (<span class="ch">與說深法，勸樂令喜</span>).</p>
<p>Clearly, this way of describing the Buddha’s effect on his students when teaching Dharma must be quite old. Like many old expressions, it may have grew in elaborateness and proliferated in frequency with time but maintained its basic meaning. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>This background is missing from MN 146, which picks up with the next paragraph and depicts an awkward conversation between the Buddha and Ānanda about Nanda while the nuns were still present. This is a somewhat common situation when comparing Theravāda with other Āgama background stories. It makes one wonder if Theravāda redactors didn’t purposely condense these stories to make room for more verbose doctrinal passages, moving the narrative details into commentaries. Alternatively, one might also wonder whether the old <em>sūtra</em>s were originally sparse on details, which motivated redactors in each tradition to fill them out independently of each other. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p>Where MN 146 is more concise in the initial background story, here it becomes much more verbose. Nanda walks the nuns through the entire argument for the selfless nature of the sense fields: That they are impermanent, painful, and subject to change, which makes it impossible for them to be self. What is curious, however, is that when the nuns confirm this conclusion for Nanda, they only state that the sense fields are impermanent. This pattern is repeated for each of the topics that Nanda raises below. Both this version and the one in T1442 omit the extended argument that impermanent things cannot be a self. On the other hand, we might say this section of MN 146 is simpler than this version because it doesn’t cover the sextet of awareness, contact, feeling, conception, intention, and craving. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>we have truly observed that there is no self in the six outer sense fields.</em> This is a more concise form of the previous conclusion given by the nuns. This abbreviation was likely the result of Chinese editing to remove what was considered excessive repetition.</p>
<p>There are a few other irregularities that take place: Nanda’s restatement of the what the nuns say loses the verb “to observe,” and then gains the adverb “truly.” The nuns also begin saying they “always” come to this understanding rather than having already done so.</p>
<p>These examples of instability in the C. translation probably don’t reflect the exact wording of the original. Usu. the initial trans. of standardized passages is the most complete and accurate one, and then repetitions become abbrev. or paraphrased in C. Āgama translations (the <cite>Madhyama Āgama</cite> being the conspicuous exception to this pattern). It’s unclear how much the translators, editors, and/or later copyists were responsible for this, but it appears to be a feature of translations from the era. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p><em>Would that speaker be explaining it correctly?</em> C. <span class="ch">作是說者，為等說不？</span>, P. <em>sammā nu kho so, bhaginiyo, vadamāno vadeyyā”ti?</em>, T1442: <span class="ch">如是說時，可說此人為<strong>實語</strong>不？</span> The expression <span class="ch">等說</span> lit. means “equally” or “fully speaking,” which likely translated G. <em>sama vadadi</em>. However, the P. equiv. is <em>sammā … vadeyyā</em> (“correctly … speaking”), and T1442 reads <span class="ch">實語</span> (“truly speaking”). So, I assume that this is another case of confusion between G. <em>sama</em> (“equal”) and <em>saṃma</em> (“correct”). I’ve amended the passage to read <span class="ch">正說</span> instead of <span class="ch">等說</span> in my translation. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p><em>Basket Serpents Sūtra.</em> Presumably this refers to SĀ 2.212 (1172). Briefly, the parable involves a chest of four dangerous vipers, five sword-wielding enemies, six bandits, an empty village, a village with bandits, a raging torrent, a river, being afraid on the near shore, and being refreshed and happy on the other shore.</p>
<p>The chest represents a person’s body of crude form, the four vipers represent the four basic elements, the five enemies represent the five acquired aggregates, and the six bandits represent the six delightful cravings. The empty village represents the six inner sense fields, and the bandits in the village represent the six outer sense fields. The raging torrent represents the four floods, and the river represents the three cravings for existence. The near shore represents being embodied, and the far shore represents <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p>It’s not clear what part of this parable we are to apply to the present passage. The next paragraph supplies its interpretation without the need for this other <em>sūtra</em>. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
