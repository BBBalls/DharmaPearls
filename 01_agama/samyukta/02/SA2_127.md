    <td id='p2'>2. There was then a monk named Samṛddhi who went to the Buddha, bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, there’s the expression ‘the world is empty.’ What does the ‘the world is empty’ mean?”</td>

    <td id='p3'>3. The Buddha told Samṛddhi, “The eye is empty. It’s empty of something constant, eternal, and unchanging and empty of something that belongs to self. Why is that? It’s naturally like this. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, feelings that dependently arise from visual contact that are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant, they are also empty. They are empty of something constant, eternal, and unchanging and empty of something that belongs to self. Why is that? They are naturally like this. <em>The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise.</em> This is called ‘the world is empty.’”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 232 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 305 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0056b21" target="_blank">T99.2.56b21-c1</a>). It’s similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.85" target="_blank">SN 35.85</a>, but both the interlocutor and the definition of “empty” is different here.</p>
<p>In SN 35.85, Ānanda is the monk who asks the Buddha about the expression “the world is empty.” SN 35.85 also says the the world is empty of self or what belongs to self. Here, “self” has been replaced with “something constant, eternal, and unchanging” (<span class="ch">常、恒、不變易法</span>), though the two expression would appear to be equiv. when we observe the arguments made against the existence of a self in other <em>sūtra</em>s. Another detail that we find here that’s absent from SN 35.85 is the assertion that the world is naturally empty of these things.</p>
<p>Apart from these superficial differences, these two <em>sūtra</em>s are the same. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
