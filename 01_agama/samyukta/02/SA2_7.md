### 7. Not Knowing (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If you don’t know and understand or stop and become free of desire for the eye, it isn’t possible to transcend the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death. Not knowing and understanding or stopping and becoming free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, it isn’t possible to transcend the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you know and understand and stop and become free of desire for the eye, it’s possible to transcend the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death. If you know and understand and stop and become free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, it’s possible to transcending the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sutra shares the same template with [SĀ 1.7](../01/SA1_7.html){:target="_blank"} but lacks a direct Pali equivalent. Cf. [SN 35.26](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.26){:target="_blank"}-[27](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.27){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
