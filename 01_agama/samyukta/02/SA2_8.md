### 8 (192). Not Knowing (3)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone doesn’t become free of desire for the eye, their mind isn’t liberated, and it isn’t possible for them to correctly end suffering. If they don’t become free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, their mind isn’t liberated, and it isn’t possible for them to correctly end suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if someone is free of desire for the eye, their mind is liberated, and it’s possible for them to correctly end suffering. Being free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, their mind is liberated, and it’s possible for them to correctly end suffering.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra shares the same template as [SĀ 1.8](../01/SA1_8.html){:target="_blank"}, and it’s a simpler version of [SN 35.26](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.26){:target="_blank"}-[27](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.27){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
