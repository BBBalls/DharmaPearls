### 8. Not Knowing (3)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If you don’t become free of desire for the eye, the mind isn’t liberated, and it isn’t possible to correctly end suffering. If you don’t become free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, the mind isn’t liberated, and it isn’t possible to correctly end suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you are free of desire for the eye, the mind is liberated, and it’s possible to correctly end suffering. Being free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, the mind is liberated, and it’s possible to correctly end suffering.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sutra shares the same template with [SĀ 1.8](../01/SA1_8.html){:target="_blank"} but lacks a direct Pali equivalent. Cf. [SN 35.26](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.26){:target="_blank"}-[27](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.27){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
