    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.56a25'>時，有比丘名三彌離提，往詣佛所，稽首佛足，退坐一面。 白佛言： 「世尊，所謂世間者。 云何名世間？」</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. There was then a monk named Samṛddhi who went to the Buddha, bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, there’s the expression [123] ‘the world’ … [124] ‘a sentient being’ … [125] ‘Māra.’ What is it that’s called ‘the world’ … ‘a sentient being’ … ‘Māra’?”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.56a27'>佛告三彌離提： 「謂眼、色、眼識、眼觸、眼觸因緣生受，內覺若苦、若樂、不苦不樂。 耳、鼻、舌、身、意、法、意識、意觸、意觸因緣生受，內覺若苦、若樂、不苦不樂。 是名世間。 所以者何？ 六入處集則觸集。 如是⋯乃至⋯純大苦聚集。</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. The Buddha told Samṛddhi, “It refers to the eye, form, visual awareness, visual contact, feelings that dependently arise from visual contact, and inner experiences that are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. It refers to the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, ideas, mental awareness, mental contact, feelings that dependently arise from mental contact, and inner experiences that are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. This is called ‘the world’ … ‘a sentient being’ … ‘Māra.’ Why is that? When the six sense fields form, then contact forms … The whole mass of suffering forms in this way.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>

    <td id='p4'>4. “Samṛddhi, suppose there’s no eye, no form, no visual awareness, no visual contact, no feelings that dependently arise from visual contact, and no inner experiences that are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. There’s no ear … nose … tongue … mind, ideas, mental awareness, mental contact, feelings that dependently arise from mental contact, or inner experiences that are painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. Then, there’s no world … no sentient being … no Māra, nor what’s supposed to be the world … a sentient being … Māra. Why is that? When the six sense fields cease, then contact ceases … The whole mass of suffering ceases in this way.”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 230 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 301-303 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0056a24" target="_blank">T99.2.56a24-b10</a>). It’s parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.65" target="_blank">SN 35.65-66</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.68" target="_blank">68</a>. The only major difference is that here dependent origination and cessation are mentioned as the reasoning behind defining these three things in terms of sensory experience. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>The full passage here would presumably include the remaining chain of dependent origination. Feeling, craving, grasping, existence, birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble have been omitted. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
