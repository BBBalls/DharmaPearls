    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that Venerable Rāhula visited the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to sit at one side, and said to the Buddha, “It would be good, Bhagavān, if you would give me an explanation of the Dharma. Having heard it, I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly. Having gone to a quiet place, focused on contemplation, and lived earnestly, I will think: ‘A clansman cuts off his hair, correctly believes not in the home life, leaves home to train on the path, cultivates the religious life, and sees the Dharma. He himself will know and realize: “My births have ended, the religious life has been established, and the task is accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 200 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 235 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0051a15" target="_blank">T99.2.51a15-1c10</a>). It depicts the way in which Rāhula became an <em>arhat</em>. It’s a different story than the one we find in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.121" target="_blank">SN 35.121</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn147" target="_blank">MN 147</a>. Here, there is less fanfare about the events about to unfold, and the story seems to relate a gradual advancement over time rather than a specific event. Another interesting aspect of this story is that it depicts the teaching that the senses and everything involved with them are impermanent as an advanced teaching that was given only when a student was ready to receive it. In this case, Rāhula was teaching other students the basics prior to receiving this higher teaching. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>teaching of dependent origination.</em> C. 尼陀那法 (MCh. nei-da-na = G. <em>nidana</em> + <em>dharma</em>). The translator here transliterated S. <em>nidāna</em>. The only other passage where this translit. is found is in the list of twelve types of <em>sūtra</em>s at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0300c06" target="_blank">T99.2.300c6</a>. <em>Nidāna sūtra</em>s typically were those in which the Buddha explains the past history of places and people. I’ve assumed that here it must refer to the teaching of dependent origination, which would naturally follow after more basic teachings like the aggregates and senses. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>incline toward </em>nirvāṇa<em>, flow toward </em>nirvāṇa<em>, and later abide in </em>nirvāṇa. C. 順趣涅槃、流注涅槃、後住涅槃. This series of three verbs associated with <em>nirvāṇa</em> occur in a few other passages in SĀ, and it is very similar to a Pali refrain found elsewhere that a teaching “slants toward <em>nibbāna</em>, slopes toward <em>nibbāna</em>, and inclines toward <em>nibbāna</em>” (P. <em>nibbānaninnaṁ nibbānapoṇaṁ nibbānapabbhāraṁ</em>).<br/>
The last of the verbs in this C. passage (後住, “later abides”) is only found here. In five other passages, the C. verb is instead 浚輸, which would mean something like “move deeply.” Several of these passages have alt. readings that replace 浚 (“to dig, deepen”) with 後 (“after, later”). If we accept this alt. reading, it would mean “afterward move toward.” This still doesn’t seem entirely satisfactory.<br/>
The idea of the liberated person going to <em>nirvāṇa</em> is found in some Buddhist texts, and this is the first occurrence of the expression in SĀ, so I’ve let the C. stand as it is in this case. The reader should understand that it is not clear what the original said. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
