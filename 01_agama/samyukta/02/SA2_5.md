### 5 (189). Correctly Contemplated

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should correctly contemplate the eye and observe that it’s impermanent. Why is that? By correctly contemplating the eye and observing that it’s impermanent, desire and greed for the eye are ended. I say the mind is correctly liberated because desire and greed are ended.
{: #p2}

3\. “By correctly contemplating the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, desire and greed [for the mind] are ended. When desire and greed are ended, I say the mind is correctly liberated.
{: #p3}

4\. “Thus, monks, someone who’s mind is correctly liberated can declare about themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
{: #p4}

5\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{: #p5}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel to [SN 35.158-9](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.158){:target="_blank"} and similar to [SĀ 1.5](../01/SA1_5.html){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
