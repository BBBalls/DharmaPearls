It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Everything is [15] impermanent … [16] painful … [17] empty … [18] not self … [19] subject to vain deeds … [20] liable to disintegrate … [21] subject to birth … [22] subject to old age … [23] subject to illness … [24] subject to death … [25] subject to grief … [26] subject to affliction … [27] subject to formation … [28] subject to cessation … [29] subject to being known … [30] subject to being well understood … [31] subject to being ended … [32] subject to realization … [33] actualized … [34] Māra … [35] Māra’s strength … [36] Māra’s tool … [37] burning … [38] blazing … [39] a conflagration. How is everything [impermanent]? It means the eye … <em>and so on</em> … is impermanent. Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or the painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise from visual contact, they are impermanent … <em>and so on</em> … too. <em>So it is with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind.</em> Whether it’s ideas, mental awareness, mental contact, or the painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise from mental contact, they are impermanent … <em>and so on</em> … too.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 196 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and nos. 193-217 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0050a24" target="_blank">T99.2.50a24-b13</a>). This group of twenty-five <em>sūtra</em>s is generally parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.33" target="_blank">SN 35.33-52</a>. The wording for liberation has been changed compared to <a href="../01/SA1_11-14.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.11-14</a> and SN 35.33-52, though the basic meaning is not different. The correspondence between the Chinese and Pali <em>sutta</em>s are as follows: SĀ 2.15 ≈ SN 35.43, 16 ≈ 44, 18 ≈ 45, 20 ≈ 39, 21 ≈ 33, 22 ≈ 34, 23 ≈ 35, 24 ≈ 36, 25 ≈ 37, 26 ≈ 38, 27 ≈ 41, 28 ≈ 42, 29 ≈ 46, 30 ≈ 47, 31 ≈ 48, 32 ≈ 49, and 33 ≈ 50. SĀ 2.17, 19, and 34-39 lack direct parallels. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
