Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, they are impermanent, painful, changing, and liable to become something else, too. <em>The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise</em>. </td>

Whether it’s form, visual awareness, visual contact, or [painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant] feelings that arise as a result of visual contact, the noble disciple becomes liberated from them, too. … the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … ideas, mental awareness, mental contact, or painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise as a result of mental contact, the noble disciple becomes liberated from them, too. I say they are liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and suffering.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 205 in the Taisho edition and no. 256 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0052b09" target="_blank">T99.2.52b9-19</a>). This <em>sūtra</em> is yet another variation of the template that many of the previous <em>sūtra</em>s have developed. It doesn’t appear to have a direct parallel in SN 35, but it shares many common passages in a different arrangement. We should also note the mention at it’s outset of a collection of “all the <em>udāna</em> verses” recited by the Buddha. This would appear to attest to the existence of such a collection in the Sarvāstivāda canon, which presumably would have paralleled the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/minor/kn/ud" target="_blank">one that survives in the Theravāda canon</a>.
