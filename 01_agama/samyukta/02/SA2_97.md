    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will give you a lecture about two things. Listen closely, and consider it well. What are the two? The eye and forms are two. The ear and sounds … the nose and odors … the tongue and flavors … the body and touches … the mind and notions are two. These are called two things.</td>

    <td id='p3'>3. “Suppose an ascetic or brahmin were to say, ‘These are not two things. The ascetic Gautama claims they are two things, but these are not two. Those who use their own reasoning to say they are two things simply say this.’ When questioned, that ascetic or brahmin wouldn’t understand. Their confusion would increase because it’s not their area.</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. “Why is that? Visual awareness arises conditioned by the eye and forms. These three things combine to condition contact. Contact gives rise to feeling, whether it’s painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. If someone doesn’t truly know the formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from feeling, they’ll plant greed for bodily contact, plant hatred of bodily contact, plant attachment to rules of bodily contact, plant self view of bodily contact, and plant the growth of bad and unskillful things. In this way, the whole mass of suffering forms and arises from that. In this way, the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind and notions condition the arising of mental awareness. These three things combine to condition contact … <em>and so on as above</em>.</td>

    <td id='p5'>5. “Furthermore, visual awareness arises dependent on the eye and forms. These three things combined into contact. Contact conditions feeling, whether it’s painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant. The formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from these feelings is known in this way. Once they are known in this way, one doesn’t plant greed for bodily contact, doesn’t plant hatred of bodily contact, doesn’t plant attachment to rules of bodily contact, doesn’t plant self view of bodily contact, and doesn’t plant bad and unskillful things. Ceasing bad and unskillful things in this way, the whole mass of suffering ceases. <em>The ear, nose, tongue, body, mind and ideas are likewise.</em>”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 213 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 275 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0054a01" target="_blank">T99.2.54a1-21</a>). Its a partial parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.92" target="_blank">SN 35.92</a>.</p>
<p>This <em>sūtra</em> includes a treatment of how not understanding contact with sensory experience leads to suffering, and how its understanding leads to the cessation of the same. This is not found in SN 35.92. The two <em>sūtra</em>s only share the initial statement about the senses and their objects being two things. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
