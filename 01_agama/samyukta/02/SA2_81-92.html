<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 208 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and nos. 259-270 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0052c07" target="_blank">T99.2.52c7-16</a>). The variant notes at the end describe three sets of four <em>sūtra</em>s, so I have partially reconstituted them as three <em>sūtra</em>s with an abbreviation embedded in each.</p>
<p>These <em>sūtra</em>s are parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.186" target="_blank">SN 35.186-194</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.7" target="_blank">SN 35.7-12</a>. SN 35.7-12 match the template better, but that set of <em>sutta</em>s doesn’t combine inner and outer sense fields. SN 35.186-194 only treat the impermanence of the inner and outer sense fields and has separate <em>sutta</em>s for the past, future, and present, respectively. Those <em>sutta</em>s belong to a group that begins at SN 35.160 that were located at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove, so it seems likely there is a direct relationship with SĀ 2.81-92. They may all form a large group of variations of a few older <em>sūtra</em>s. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
