    <td title='t99.2.50a12'>爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「一切無常。 云何一切無常？ 謂眼無常。 若色、眼識、眼觸、若眼觸因緣生受，苦覺、樂覺、不苦不樂覺，彼亦無常。 耳、鼻、舌、身、意亦復如是。</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Everything is [11] impermanent … [12] painful … [13] empty … [14] not self. How is everything impermanent? It means the eye is impermanent … painful … empty … not self. Whether it’s forms, visual awareness, visual contact, or the painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise from visual contact, they are impermanent … painful … empty … not self, too. <em>The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise.</em></td>

    <td title='t99.2.50a15'>「多聞聖弟子如是觀者，於眼生厭。 若色、眼識、眼觸、眼觸因緣生受，苦覺、樂覺、不苦不樂覺，於彼生厭。 耳⋯鼻⋯舌⋯身⋯意⋯聲⋯香⋯味⋯觸⋯法、意識、意觸、意觸因緣生受，苦覺、樂覺、不苦不樂覺，彼亦生厭。 厭故不樂。 不樂故解脫。 解脫知見： 『我生已盡，梵行已立，所作已作。 自知不受後有。』」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. “The well-versed noble disciple who contemplates it in this way becomes disillusioned with the eye. Whether it’s forms, visual awareness, visual contact, or the painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise from visual contact, they become disillusioned with it. They become disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … sounds … odors … flavors … touches … ideas … [auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and] mental awareness, mental contact, and the painful, pleasant, and neither painful nor pleasant feelings that arise from mental contact, too. Because the disciple becomes disillusioned with them, they don’t enjoy them. Because they don’t enjoy those things, they are liberated. Being liberated, they know and see this: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to another existence.’”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 195 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 189-92 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0050a11" target="_blank">T99.2.50a11-23</a>). This group of <em>sūtra</em>s resembles <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.1" target="_blank">SN 35.1-12</a>, but these <em>sūtra</em>s apply the template to everything, which is defined in the same way as in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.23" target="_blank">SN 35.23-32</a>. Overall, I would say these <em>sūtra</em>s represent variations on the same theme, recombining equivalent passages to arrive at the same the basic meaning. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
