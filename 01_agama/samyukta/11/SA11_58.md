### 58. Ten Powers

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are ten kinds of the Tathāgata’s power. If these powers are accomplished, it be by the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. Before becoming a buddha, he attained the highest abode of knowledge. He turned the Brahma wheel and roared the lion’s roar amid his great assembly. What are the ten? The Tathāgata knows what’s possible and impossible as they really are. This is called his first power …” *And so on up to the end of contaminants as was recited above in SA 11.41.*
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p3}
