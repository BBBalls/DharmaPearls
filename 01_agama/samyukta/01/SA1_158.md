The acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of awareness. Suppose an ascetic or priest is aware of their various past lives using the knowledge of past lives. That past awareness, future awareness, or present awareness are all about these five acquired aggregates. [They think this] about that past awareness, future awareness, or present awareness: ‘Throughout my past, my form was thus, my feeling was thus, my conception was thus, my volition was thus, and my awareness was thus.’</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 46 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 158 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0011b21" target="_blank">T99.2.11b21-12a8</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.79" target="_blank">SN 22.79</a>. Note that there are some significant departures between the two versions. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>distinguishing</em>. The Chinese here could be a literal translation of <em>vi-</em> (別) <em>-jñā-</em> (知), meaning “separate knowing.” I’ve matched this to English “distinguish” in the sense of discerning something separately from other things. In SN 22.79, the parallel verb is <em>vijānāti</em>, which can mean “comprehends, understands, recognises, distinguishes, is aware (of).” [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>completely cease</em>. C. 滅患. The Taisho reading, which lit. means “ceasing troubles,” doesn’t occur anywhere else in SĀ. Yinshun suggests amending 滅患 to 滅盡, but I would go further and suggest amending 滅患、向滅 to 正向滅盡 (“correctly headed to complete cessation”). The entire expression 厭、離欲、正向滅盡 occurs in SĀ 1.11-14 (8), and the more concise 離欲、滅盡 occurs dozens of times throughout SĀ. 向滅 only occurs here and in SĀ 1.11-14, so it doesn’t seem to belong. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>decrease and don’t increase</em>. C. 滅而不增. Given that 滅 is repeated again in the expression 滅而不起 (“ceased and aren’t produced”), I’ve followed Yinshun’s suggestion to amend 滅 (“cease, destroy”) to 減 (“decrease, reduce”) in this expression. There is also an occurrence of the expression 減而不增 alongside 滅而不起 in SĀ 1.177 (109). [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
