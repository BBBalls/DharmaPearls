<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 257 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 40 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0064c20" target="_blank">T99.2.64c20-65a12</a>). It’s the second of three <em>sūtra</em>s that correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.129" target="_blank">SN 22.129-135</a>. Their closest parallels are <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.133" target="_blank">SN 22.133-135</a>, which combine the definition of ignorance and insight into a single discourse. This particular <em>sūtra</em> is closest to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.135" target="_blank">SN 22.135</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
