    <td id='p2'>2. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat. [He adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder,] bowed to the Buddha, [and withdrew to stand at one side]. He then said to the Buddha, “[It would be good,] Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly. Having lived earnestly, I’ll then think, “A good son [leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes,] believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home … <em>up to</em> … ‘“I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 19 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 25 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0004a28" target="_blank">T99.2.4a28-b24</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0027a08" target="_blank">Y30.27a8-28a6</a>). It’s a variant of <a href="SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a>, and it has a parallel in Pali at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.34" target="_blank">SN 22.34</a>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33" target="_blank">SN 22.33</a> follows the same template but includes a simile not found here. It’s also similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.65" target="_blank">SN 22.65</a>, but that <em>sutta</em> adds Māra and delighting in the five aggregates to the advice given. The next and previous two <em>sūtra</em>s are variants that substitute different principles for the monk to contemplate. See <a href="SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a> for the full passages that were abbreviated here. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
