### 161. Ānanda

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Suppose a faithful prominent man or a prominent man’s son comes and asks you, ‘How do I know the arising and ceasing of things?’ How would you answer him?”
{:#p2}

3\. Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, if some prominent man or a prominent man’s son came and asked me that, I would answer, ‘Know that form is something that arises and ceases, know that feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is something that arises and ceases.’ Bhagavān, if a prominent man or a prominent man’s son thus questions me, I would thus answer him.”
{:#p3}

4\. The Buddha told Ānanda, “Good, good! You should thus answer him. Why is that? Form is something that arises and ceases, feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is something that arises and ceases. Knowing that form is something that arises and ceases is called knowing form. Knowing that feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is something that arises and ceases is called knowing feeling … conception … volition … consciousness.”
{:#p4}

5\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p5}

### Notes
