<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 43 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 155 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0010c19" target="_blank">T99.2.10c19-11a12</a>). This and the next <em>sūtra</em> have a clear similarity with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.7" target="_blank">SN 22.7</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.8" target="_blank">8</a>. In this version, fear is tangential to the subject of the lecture. Rather, the Buddha teaches how grasping leads to attachment, and fear is a result of this process. SN 22.7 is a closer match to this and the next <em>sūtra</em> than SN 22.8. All four appear to be variants of some older original. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>If that form changes … his mind also changes along with it … as he accepts a mental abode.</em> C. <span class="ch">彼色若變、若異，心亦隨轉。心隨轉已，亦生取著，攝受心住</span>, P. <em>Tassa taṁ rūpaṁ vipariṇamati aññathā hoti. Tassa rūpavipariṇāmaññathābhāvā rūpavipariṇāmānuparivatti viññāṇaṁ hoti.</em> I have translated the C. somewhat literally. The equiv. passage in SN 22.7 does not include the statement about accepting a mental abode (<span class="ch">攝受心住</span>), which is frustrating since the lit. reading seems awkward. However, it does tie into the idea of the other four aggregates forming a substrate on which awareness depends to continue to exist, which is found in <a href="SA1_151.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.151</a> and <a href="SA1_152.html" target="_blank">152</a>. Here, the same idea is perhaps being related to the identification of the aggregates as being related to a self of some kind. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
