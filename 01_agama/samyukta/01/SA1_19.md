<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 13 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 19 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0002b15" target="_blank">T99.2.2b15-c10</a>). It and the next <em>sūtra</em> correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.26" target="_blank">SN 22.26-28</a>, and this <em>sūtra</em> is closest to SN 22.27-28. The beginning matches SN 22.28 while the conclusion matches SN 22.27. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>affected</em>. C. 染. The parallel term in SN 22.28 is P. <em>sārajjati</em> (S. <em>saṁrajyate</em>). Interestingly, the S. equivalent of this word means “to dye, turn red, become affected by passion.” This matches 染, which normally means “to stain, dye, or color” things such as fabric. Psychologically, it can refer to people being influenced by something or someone else. All in all, I would say the word in this passage means “to be affected” or “impassioned.” The common reading of “to be defiled” would be an extension of the negative context of passages like this, not to mention that soiled fabric is often stained by dirt. But here the reading is psychological, not literal, so I have rendered it to English accordingly. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>unsurpassed and complete awakening</em>. C. 阿耨多羅三藐三菩提 (EMC. <em>•a-nəu-ta-la sam-miɛu sam-bo-dei</em>), G. <em>anutara saṃma saṃboj̄a</em>, P. <em>anuttara sammā sambodhi</em>, S. <em>anuttara samyak saṃbodhi</em>. This expression, which became quite common in later works, usu. only applies to the awakening of the Buddha, as is the case here. Lit., it means the “unsurpassed, correct, and complete awakening.” I’ve contracted the expression a bit for brevity. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
