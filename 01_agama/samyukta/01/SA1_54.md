    <td id='p3'>3. There was then a monk in that group who went to the Buddha, bowed at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to sit at one side.

He doesn’t guard the doors of his faculties, doesn’t know how much food is enough, and he isn’t awake in the first and last watch of the night. He’s indolent and lazy, doesn’t make diligent effort, and doesn’t skillfully investigate and consider the good Dharma. It’s not possible for him to discern the Dharma, feel happy cultivating the religious life, be free of sleepiness, or be free of doubts about the correct Dharma. If he’s going to be a monk, he should guard the doors of his faculties, know what’s enough food, stay awake and apply himself during the first and last watch of the night, and observe the good Dharma. Then it’ll be possible for him to delight in discerning the Dharma, enjoy cultivating the religious life, be free of sleepiness, and not have doubts about the Dharma.”<sup id="ref3"><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></td>

    <td id='p14'>14. The Buddha told Tiṣya, “That parable is thus: The man who didn’t know the road is like a foolish ordinary man. The one who knew the road is like the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. The first fork in the road is a sentient being having doubts. The road to the left is three unskillful things: greedy, hateful, and harmful perceptions. The road to the right is three skillful things: the escape of perceptions that are free of desire, hate, or harmfulness. Proceeding on the road to the left would be wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong method, wrong mindfulness, and wrong <em>samādhi</em>. Proceeding on the road to the right would be right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right <em>samādhi</em>.

    <td id='p15'>15. The Buddha told Tiṣya, “The Buddha is the great teacher who has accomplished the task for his disciples. Now, he has accomplished all this with the goal of happiness out of sympathy and caring. Today, all of you should accomplish that task. You should go [to a place] under a tree, on open ground, or in a mountain grotto, spread out a seat of grass, and contemplate skillfully with right mindfulness.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 271 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 54 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0071a04" target="_blank">T99.2.71a4-c13</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.84" target="_blank">SN 22.84</a>. Both this and the Pali parallel include details not found in the other, but overall the Pali version is a bit more detailed. One of the more significant differences is that this version uses the metaphor of <em>nirvāṇa</em> being a city, while the Theravāda version likens <em>nirvāṇa</em> to a flat and delightful parcel of land. The “city of <em>nirvāṇa</em>” was a recurring metaphor in northern Buddhist texts, and it’s interesting that the parallel passage in SN 22.84 does liken <em>nirvāṇa</em> to a happy destination. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Tiṣya</em>. C. 低舍 (EMC. tei-ʃɪă), G. <em>tiśa</em> or <em>tiṣa</em>, P. <em>tissa</em>, S. <em>tiṣya</em>. The C. translit. matches G. attestations. I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. In SN 22.84, he is identified as a cousin of the Buddha. See <a href="https://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tissa.htm" target="_blank">entry 14 on the name Tissa</a> in the <cite>Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</cite> for more about this character in Theravāda sources. He was apparently known for napping too much among other things. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3">This lengthy criticism of Tiṣya doesn’t occur in SN 22.84, but it is apparently the inspiration of the title for this <em>sūtra</em> found in the summary verse after <a href="SA1_55.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.55</a>, [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4">This parable is a little different than the one in SN 22.84. Specifically, this version has two forks in the road, while in SN 22.84 there is an extra landmark on the way to the destination. Briefly, the metaphors in the Theravāda version are: The unskilled traveller is the ordinary person, and the skilled traveller is the Buddha. The fork in the road is doubt. The left-hand path is the wrong eightfold path. The right-hand path is the noble eightfold path. The forest grove is ignorance, low-lying marshes is sensual pleasures, and a large cliff is anger and distress. Finally, a level parkland represents <em>nirvāṇa</em>.<br/>
It’s of interest to note that here the three things that constitute wrong or right intention in the eightfold path are placed before the practitioner reaches that path. This is not the case in SN 22.84. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5">The conclusion in SN 22.84 is quite brief: “Rejoice, Tissa, rejoice! I’m here to advise you, to support you, and to teach you” (<em>Abhirama, tissa, abhirama, tissa. Ahamovādena ahamanuggahena ahamanusāsaniyā”ti.</em>). [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
