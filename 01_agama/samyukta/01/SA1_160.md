### 160 (48). Faithful (2)

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\.  It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A good son of correct faith who’s not at home and has left home thinks to himself, ‘I should follow the teaching. I will often cultivate disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivate disillusionment with consciousness.’
{:#p2}

3\. “A good son who is correctly faithful, not at home, and has left home then often cultivates disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivates disillusionment with consciousness. He becomes disillusioned with form … feeling … conception … volition … becomes disillusioned with consciousness. He then attains the escape from form … feeling … conception … volition … attains the escape from consciousness. I say that he will be free from all birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}
