### 14. Past (4)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Past and future form is not self, so why wouldn’t present form? Noble disciples thus observe them. They don’t look back to past form, don’t wish for future form, and become disillusioned and free of desire for present form. They’re correctly headed toward its complete cessation.
{:#p2}

3\. “Thus, past and future feeling … perception … volition … consciousness is not self, so why wouldn’t present consciousness? Noble disciples thus observe them. They don’t look back to past consciousness, don’t wish for future consciousness, and become disillusioned and free of desire for present consciousness. They’re correctly headed toward complete cessation.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}
