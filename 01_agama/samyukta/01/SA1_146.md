If form had a self, it wouldn’t be that illness and pain arise from form, and there wouldn’t be these desires about form: ‘Let it be so; let it not be so.’ Because form has no self, illness and pain that arise from it, and these desires become possible: ‘Let it be so; let it not be so.’ <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise.</em></td>

Observing them in this way, they take hold of nothing from all the world. Because they take hold of nothing, they have no attachments. Because they have no attachments, they realize <em>nirvāṇa</em> for themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 34 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 146 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0007c13" target="_blank">T99.2.7c13-8a4</a>). This is the famous second sermon that the Buddha taught to his first five disciples according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition. It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59" target="_blank">SN 22.59</a> and <a href="../../other/T102.html" target="_blank">T102</a>, and <a href="SA1_143.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.143</a>-<a href="SA1_145.html" target="_blank">145</a> are only slightly different variants of the same discourse.
