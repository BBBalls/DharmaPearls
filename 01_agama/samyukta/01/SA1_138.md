    <td id='p3'>3. That Licchavi man thought to himself, ‘If I visit the Bhagavān in the morning, the Bhagavān and the monks who are my friends will all be meditating. I’ll go visit the ājīvika heretics at Seven Mango Trees.” He then went to visit Pūraṇa Kāśyapa at his residence.</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. Pūraṇa Kāśyapa was the leader of an assembly of another tradition. He was surrounded front and back by five hundred disciples who were loud and boisterous as they discussed ordinary affairs.</td>

    <td title='t99.2.20c6'>時，富蘭那迦葉遙見離車摩訶男來，告其眷屬，令寂靜住：「汝等默然！是離車摩訶男是沙門瞿曇弟子，此是沙門瞿曇白衣弟子，毘耶離中最為上首，常樂靜寂，讚歎寂靜，彼所之詣寂靜之眾，是故汝等應當寂靜。」</td>
    <td id='p5'>5. When he saw the Licchavi Mahānāma coming from a distance, Pūraṇa Kāśyapa told his followers to settle down: “Quiet, all of you! This Licchavi Mahānāma is a disciple of the ascetic Gautama. This white-robed disciple of the ascetic Gautama is a high-ranking person in Vaiśālī. He always delights in peace, praises peace, and visits peaceful assemblies; therefore, all of you must be peaceful.”</td>

    <td title='t99.2.20c13'>時，摩訶男語富蘭那言：「我聞富蘭那為諸弟子說法：『無因、無緣眾生有垢，無因、無緣眾生清淨。』世有此論，汝為審有此，為是外人相毀之言？世人所撰，為是法、為非法，頗有世人共論、難問、嫌責以不？」</td>
    <td id='p7'>7. Mahānāma said to Pūraṇa, “I’ve heard that Pūraṇa teaches his disciples this: ‘There’s no cause or condition for sentient beings to be defiled and no cause or condition for sentient beings to be purified.’ The world has these theories. Has it been put forward by you, or are these words used by those of other traditions to slander you? In the judgement of worldly people, is this Dharma or not Dharma? Haven’t there been worldly people who’ve discussed it with you, questioned it critically, and rejected it?”</td>

  <tr>
    <td title='t99.2.20c17'>富蘭那迦葉言：「實有此論，非世妄傳。我立此論，是如法論，我說此法，皆是順法，無有世人來共難問而呵責者。所以者何？摩訶男！我如是見、如是說：『無因、無緣眾生有垢，無因、無緣眾生清淨。』」</td>
    <td id='p8'>8. Pūraṇa Kāśyapa said, “I really have this theory; it isn’t a worldly misrepresentation. I established this theory as a theory that accords with Dharma. I teach this Dharma, and I follow the Dharma. There aren’t any worldly people who come to question it critically and reject it. Why is that? Mahānāma, I thus see and thus teach, ‘There’s no cause or condition for sentient beings to be defiled and no cause or condition for sentient beings to be purified.’”</td>

  <tr>
    <td title='t99.2.20c22'>時，摩訶男聞富蘭那所說，心不喜樂，呵罵已，從坐起去，向世尊所，頭面禮足，却坐一面，以向與富蘭那所論事，向佛廣說。</td>
    <td id='p9'>9. After he heard what Pūraṇa said, Mahānāma wasn’t delighted and felt insulted, so he got up from his seat and left. He went to the Bhagavān, bowed his head at his feet, and withdrew to sit to one side. He then recounted his conversation with Pūraṇa to the Buddha in detail.</td>

    <td title='t99.2.20c24'>佛告離車摩訶男：「彼富蘭那為出意語，不足記也。如是富蘭那愚癡，不辨、不善、非因而作是說：『無因、無緣眾生有垢，無因、無緣眾生清淨。』所以者何？有因、有緣眾生有垢，有因、有緣眾生清淨。</td>
    <td id='p10'>10. The Buddha told the Licchavi Mahānāma, “That Pūraṇa speaks from intellect, which isn’t enough to decide the matter. Thus, Pūraṇa is foolish, undiscerning, and unskillful. He has no cause to say, ‘There’s no cause or condition for sentient beings to be defiled and no cause or condition for sentient beings to be purified.’ Why is that? There are causes and conditions for sentient beings to be defiled, and there are causes and conditions for sentient beings to be purified.</td>

Mahānāma, if form were solely painful, not pleasant, not pleasing, didn’t nurture pleasure, and was free of pleasure, sentient beings wouldn’t become attached to pleasure as a result. Mahānāma, form isn’t solely painful. It’s pleasant, pleasing, nurtures pleasure, and isn’t free of pleasure; therefore, sentient beings have defiled attachment to form.
