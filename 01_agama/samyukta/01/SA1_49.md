It was then that the Buddha addressed the monks, “The starting point of suffering is unknown [to sentient beings who] circulate through beginningless births and deaths while shrouded by ignorance and tied up by the bond of craving. There are droughts that last a long time, when the hundred grains, plants, and trees that grow on the land all wither and dry up. Monks, while they’re shrouded by ignorance and tied up by the bond of craving, sentient beings will circulate through births and deaths. They haven’t cut the bond of craving nor reached the end of suffering.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 266 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 49 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0069b04" target="_blank">T99.2.69b4-c1</a>). It and the next <em>sūtra</em> together represent a variant of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.99" target="_blank">SN 22.99</a>. It’s only slightly different in structure and includes the same explanatory similes. However, the ignorance that causes sentient beings to be trapped in the cycle of birth and death is defined here as not knowing the aggregates and their formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape. In SN 22.99, ignorance is described as taking the aggregates as self. The next <em>sūtra</em> continues this discourse, taking the simile of the dog tied to a post as a point of departure. <a href="SA1_50.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.50</a> appears to be a commentary that became a companion <em>sūtra</em> to this one. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>for a long night</em>. C. 長夜, P. <em>dīgha ratti</em>, S. <em>dīrgha rātri</em>. This was a poetic way of saying “for eons,” as this <em>sūtra</em> makes clear by equating it with cosmological events. The eons that pass after the world is destroyed really can be called a literal long night, since there is no sun or moon. Sentient beings during this interval exist only in the heavens above the Brahma world. Usu., the darkness of the long night is metaphorical, as sentient beings cycle through eons of birth and death in ignorance. This expression doesn’t occur in SN 22.99, but it is found in other Theravāda sources. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
