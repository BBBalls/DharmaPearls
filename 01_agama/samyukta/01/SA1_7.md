It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When one doesn’t know and understand form and doesn’t stop and become free of desire for it, their mind isn’t liberated, and then they can’t transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death. Thus, when one doesn’t know and understand feeling … conception … volition … awareness and doesn’t stop and become free of desire for it, their mind isn’t liberated, and then they can’t transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death.</td>

<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 4 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 7 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0001b06" target="_blank">T99.2.1b6-15</a>). It’s a variant of the previous and next two <em>sūtra</em>s. As a group, they are parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24" target="_blank">SN 22.24</a>, and this <em>sūtra</em> is also parallel with <a href="../02/SA2_7.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.7</a>. See the notes to <a href="SA1_6.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.6</a> for more about its relationship to its Pali counterpart.[<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2">The first sentence of this paragraph was apparently copied twice by an inattentive copyist. I’ve followed Yinshun’s suggestion to delete one of them.[<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
