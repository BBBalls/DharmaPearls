<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 264 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 47 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0067c04" target="_blank">T99.2.67c4-8b28</a>). It’s parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.96" target="_blank">SN 22.96</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ma61" target="_blank">MĀ 61</a>. The latter is interesting in that it represents a different version from another Savāstivāda canon, where it was placed in the <em>Madhyama Āgama</em>.</p>
<p>The main difference between the SN 22.96 and these parallels is that it lacks the passage in which the Buddha lists several different forms of rebirth in the heavens as a result of cultivating merit. It also lacks the conclusion that depicts the monk following the teaching and becoming an <em>arhat</em>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>remains permanent, eternal, unchanging, and the same.</em> C. 常、恒、不變易、正住, P. <em>nicca dhuva sassata avipariṇāmadhamma sassatisama tatheva ṭhassati</em>. The meaning of 正住 is the main difficulty in this passage. Without looking at the P. parallel, it would seem to mean “correct abode,” reading 正 as modifying 住 and the pair forming another descriptor of the aggregates. However, when we consult the parallel passage in SN 22.96, we find that <em>ṭhassati</em> (“will remain”) corresponds to 住 as the verb of the sentence, and 正 corresponds to <em>sassatisama</em> (“always the same”). The confusion is caused by the translator retaining the Indic SOV grammar in C., which uses a SVO grammar.</p>
<p>Beyond this, it would seem that two things have happened in these two texts. In the P. parallel, <em>sassati</em> has been added to <em>sama</em> to create a clearer meaning, which was a common practice in Buddhist texts. In the C. translation, G. <em>sama</em> (“same, equal”) has been confused for G. <em>saṃma</em> (“correct, proper”), which sometimes happened because <em>saṃma</em> was routinely abbrev. to <em>sama</em> in G.</p>
<p>As a result of this, I’ve amended 正 to 等 but otherwise maintained the C. reading with the understanding that 住 is the main verb of the clause. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>small clod of dirt.</em> C. 小土摶, P. <em>paritta gomayapiṇḍa</em>. The expressions are the same in the other two parallels other than one has “earth” and the other “cowdung.” 摶 often translated the equiv. of P. <em>piṇḍa</em>, which occurs more commonly to describe a bite of food. In MĀ 61, the expression has been made even more dramatic: “scooped a little cowdung with his fingernail” (指爪抄少牛糞). [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>This description of different kinds of rebirth are not found in SN 22.96. MĀ 61 omits this section describing noble wheel-turning king rebirths, but it does include the rebirths in heaven. Instead of a section on wheel-turning king rebirths, MĀ 61 has the Buddha being reborn “measureless times” as “warrior head-born kings” (S. <em>kṣatriya mūrdhajāta</em>). This was apparently a variation of the expression we find in P. and here in SĀ that lit. means “head-consecrated” king (<em>muddhāvasitta</em>, C. 灌頂王, S. <em>mūrdhābhiṣikta</em>). This “head consecration” seems to have referred to an ascension ritual that involved sprinkling water on the new king’s head.</p>
<p>Here in SĀ, this passage about being reborn as noble wheel-turning kings is curious. Was the wheel-turning king considered the same as the anointed king that’s described below, or were they different types of kings? The confusion between the three parallels suggests that the wheel-turning king wasn’t mentioned here at all in the common ancestor text. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>Upavasatha.</em> C. 布薩 (EMC. po-sat), G. <em>posatha</em>, P. <em>uposatha</em>, S. <em>upavasatha</em>. The C. appears to translit. the G. equiv. of P. <em>uposatha</em> (dropping the final syllable as usu.). This was the name for Buddhist days of fasting and observing precepts. The elephant king is named the same in the P. parallel. The name found in MĀ 61 is unclear. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>Vālaha.</em> C. 婆羅 (EMC. bua-la), G. <em>vala</em>, P. <em>valāhaka</em>, S. <em>vālaha</em>?. The C. likely translit. G. <em>vala</em>, but it’s not clear what the intended meaning would be. The P. parallel has adopted the reading <em>valāhaka</em>, which means a storm cloud. The alt. C. parallel in MĀ 61 translates the name as 䭷 (“horse with a long mane”). However, a passage below makes it clearer that the reading is actually S. <em>vālaha</em> (C. 婆羅訶) like the P. parallel. This S. word refers to an animal’s tail and would agree more with MĀ 61’s translation. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p><em>wool fabric.</em> C.欽婆羅 (EMC. k‘ɪəm-bua-la), G. ?, P. <em>kambala</em>, S. <em>kambala</em>. The C. appears to translit. a word equiv. to P./S. <em>kambala</em>, meaning fabric made of wool. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p><em>Vaijayantaghoṣa.</em> C. 毗闍耶難提音聲 (EMC. bii-ʒɪă-yiă-nan-dei + “voice”), P. <em>vejayanta</em>, S. vaijayantaghoṣa. MĀ 61 translates this name as 樂聲 (“delightful voice”). 毗闍耶難提 appears to translit. an expression like S. <em>vaijayanta</em>, which is the name of Śakra’s palace and means “Triumph” or “Banner.” 音聲 likely translates <em>ghoṣa</em>, as indicated in the translit. that occurs below. There also appears to be a prefix 䟦求 that’s unclear. As a translit., it might represent Pr. <em>vagu</em> or <em>bagu</em>. It isn’t included in the translit. below, so I’ve set it aside as perhaps a corruption of the C. text. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p><em>Kuśavatī</em>. C. 拘舍婆提 (EMC. kɪu-ʃɪă-bua-dei), G. <em>kuśavadi</em>, P. <em>kusāvatī</em>, S. <em>*kuśavatī</em>. The C. translit. matches the G. pronunciation best. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p><em>Yoha</em>. C. 由訶 (EMC. yiəu-ha), P. <em>dhamma</em>. It’s unclear what this name means. The C. translit. is likely a Pr. pronunciation that may be equiv. to S. <em>yojana</em>, but this doesn’t seem very meaningful as a reading. I’ve reproduced the C. translit. in this case given that I’m not certain of its true S. equiv. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n11"><p><em>antelope</em>. C. 迦陵伽 (EMC. kă-lɪəŋ-gɪă), G. <em>karaṅga</em>, P. <em>kadalimiga</em>, S. <em>kuraṅga</em>. The P. parallel reading is a kind of antelope deer hide. The C. translit. is well-known for <em>kaliṅga</em>, the name of a country in ancient India. However, it could also sound out a word like S. <em>kuraṅga</em>, which was the name of an Indian antelope. This makes better sense in the present context and in light of the P. parallel. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n12"><p><em>silk cloth, linen cloth, </em>dukūla<em> cloth, and </em>kukova<em>? cloth</em>. C. 迦尸細衣 (EMC. kă-ʃɪi-sei)、芻摩衣 (EMC. ṭṣ‘ïu-mua)、頭鳩羅衣 (EMC. dəu-kɪəu-la)、拘沾(沽)婆衣 (EMC. kɪu-t‘em(ko)-bua), P. khomasukhumāni koseyyasukhumāni kambalasukhumāni kappāsikasukhumāni.</p>
<p>The first C. translit. name doesn’t exactly match the well known S. <em>kauśeya</em> for a kind of silk, but I’ve guessed the C. might be corrupt or the original word some obscure Pr. pronunciation for the same.</p>
<p>The second item most likely translit. G. <em>*kṣoma</em>, which is equiv. to P. <em>khoma</em> and S. <em>kṣauma</em>. This was a type of linen cloth.</p>
<p>The third translit. is P/S. <em>dukūla</em>, which was another kind of fine linen made from bark fiber. It was apparently comparable to silk and often confused with true silk.</p>
<p>The last item, which I’ve guessed was a translit. of something like Pr. <em>kukova</em>, is obscure to me. The <em>Taisho</em>’s 拘沾婆 might be a corruption of 拘沽婆 (or <em>vice versa</em>). 拘沽婆 has an entry in a Chinese glossary (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T54n2130_p1051b15" target="_blank">T2130.54.1051b15</a>), which claims that it was the name of a country. If so, it’s not a country I’ve been able to identify.</p>
<p>MĀ 61 lists five types of cloth: linen (<em>kṣoma</em>), silk, silk (<em>dukūla</em>?), cotton, and antelope skin (~ S. <em>kuraṅga-pravara</em>?) (初摩衣、錦衣、繒衣、劫貝衣、加陵伽波惒邏衣). [<a href="#ref12">back</a>]</p></li>
