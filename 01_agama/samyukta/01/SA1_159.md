### 159 (47). Faithful

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A faithful good son should have this thought, ‘I should follow the teaching. I will often cultivate disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivate disillusionment with consciousness.’
{:#p2}

3\. “A faithful good son then often cultivates disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivates disillusionment with consciousness. He becomes disillusioned with form … feeling … conception … volition … becomes disillusioned with consciousness. After being disillusioned, he parts with desire for it and is liberated from it. Being liberated, he knows and sees: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}
