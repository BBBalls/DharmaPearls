Once that has been abandoned, you’ll be happy for a long night. Monks, what are the things that don’t belong to you that ought to be quickly abandoned? In this way, form … feeling … conception … volition … awareness doesn’t belong to you and ought to be completely abandoned. Once that has stopped, you’ll be happy for a long night.</td>

Because those trees aren’t oneself, nor do they belong to oneself. Thus, monks, whatever doesn’t belong to you ought to be completely abandoned.

In this way, whatever feelings … conceptions … volitions … instances of awareness there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all not self, not different than self, and neither is present in the other. A noble disciple observes these five acquired aggregates as not self or belonging to self. When they observe them in this way, they will have no attachments to anything in any world. Having no attachments, they will attain their own <em>nirvāṇa</em>: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence.’”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 269 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 52 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0070b01" target="_blank">T99.2.70b1-c1</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33" target="_blank">SN 22.33-34</a>. It shares the same metaphor as found in SN 22.33 that likens the five aggregates to kindling wood that a person collects in Jeta’s Grove. In the P. version, the absurdity of considering kindling to be part of oneself is brought out more clearly. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
