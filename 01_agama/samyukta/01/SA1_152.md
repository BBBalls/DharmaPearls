### 152. Involvement

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Someone involved isn’t liberated, but when they aren’t involved, then they are liberated. How is someone involved not liberated? Monks, consciousness abides in its substrates of four acquired aggregates. What are the four? Consciousness abides involved with form. Consciousness abides involved with feeling … perception … volition… *as in SĀ 1.151.5* … because it’s something that’s impossible. This is called someone not being liberated because they are involved.
{:#p2}

3\. “How is someone who isn’t involved then liberated? Parting with greed for the element of form and parting with greed for the element of feeling … perception … volition … *as in SĀ 1.151.7-9* … quenched in truth. This is someone being liberated because they are not involved.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is similar to [SĀ 1.151](SA1_151.html){:target="_blank"} and [SN 22.43](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.43){:target="_blank"} but simpler and with less emphasis on involvement. [\[back\]](#ref1)
