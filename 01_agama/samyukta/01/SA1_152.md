### 152. Blockage

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Someone blocked isn’t liberated, but when they aren’t blocked, then they are liberated. How is someone blocked and not liberated? Monks, consciousness abides growing on the four acquired aggregates. What are the four? Form blocks the abiding of consciousness. Feeling … perception … volition blocks the abiding of consciousness … because they aren’t its domain, this is called blockage. Therefore, one is not liberated.
{:#p2}

3\. “How is someone who isn’t blocked liberated? Being free of greed for the element of form and being free of greed for the element of feeling … perception … volition … they are quenched and true. This then not being block and liberated.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{: #p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.43](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.43){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
