### 50 (267). Lack of Knowledge (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Buddha addressed the monks, “Sentient beings don’t know the extent of suffering who circulate through beginningless births and deaths while shrouded by ignorance and tied up by the bond of craving. Monks, take the example of a dog that’s tied to a post with a rope. Because it hasn’t broken that bond that ties it, the dog turns around the post. Whether it stands or lies down, it doesn’t leave the post. In this way, ordinary, foolish sentient beings circle form and turn around form while they aren’t free of greed, craving, thought, and thirst for form. Whether they stand or lie down, they don’t leave form. In this way, they turn around feeling … conception … volition … awareness. Whether they stand or lie down, they don’t leave awareness.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, one should contemplate and observe the mind well. Why is that? Because the mind has been affected by greed … hatred … affected by delusion for a long night. Monks, sentient beings are troubled because their minds are troubled, and sentient beings are purified because their minds are purified. Monks, I don’t see a single form as varied as that of a multi-colored bird, but its mind goes beyond that. Why is that? That animal’s form is diverse because its mind is diverse.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2}
{:#p3}

4\. “Therefore, monks, you should contemplate and observe the mind well. Monks, the mind has been affected by greed … hatred … affected by delusion for a long night. Sentient beings are troubled because their minds are troubled, and sentient beings are purified because their minds are purified. Monks, have you seen the diverse and varied colors of the <em>cāraṇa</em> bird?”[\[3\]](#n3){:#ref3}
{:#p4}

They answered, “We’ve seen it, Bhagavān.”


5\. The Buddha told the monks, “I say that <em>cāraṇa</em> bird has diverse and varied colors because its mind is diverse and varied, too. Why is that? Because its mind is diverse, that <em>cāraṇa</em> bird’s color is diverse. Therefore, you should examine and contemplate the mind well, for it has been affected by diverse greeds, hatreds, and delusions for a long night. Sentient beings are troubled because their minds are troubled, and sentient beings are purified because their minds are purified.
{:#p5}

6\. They’re like an artist or an artist’s apprentice who skillfully arranges a white cloth on the ground, prepares a variety of pigments, and paints a variety of images as he likes.
{:#p6}

7\. “In this way, monks, ordinary sentient beings don’t truly know form, the formation of form, cessation of form, trouble of form, or escape from form. Because they don’t truly know form, they delight in form. Because they delight in form, they are reborn with future forms. In this way, ordinary, foolish sentient beings don’t truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness, the formation of awareness, cessation of awareness, trouble of awareness, and escape from awareness. Because they don’t truly know awareness, they delight in awareness. Because they delight in awareness, they are reborn with future instances of awareness. Because they will be born with future form … feeling … conception … volition … awareness, they aren’t freed from form … feeling … conception … volition … aren’t freed from awareness. I say that they aren’t freed from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain.
{:#p7}

8\. “There are well-versed noble disciples who truly know form, the formation of form, cessation of form, trouble of form, and escape from form. Because they truly know form, they don’t delight in form. Because they don’t delight in form, they aren’t reborn with future forms. In this way, they truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness, the formation of awareness, cessation of awareness, trouble of awareness, and escape from awareness. Because they truly know awareness, they don’t delight in awareness. Because they don’t delight in awareness, they aren’t reborn with future instances of awareness. Because they won’t be born with future form … feeling … conception … volition … awareness, they are freed from form … feeling … conception … volition … freed from awareness. I say that they are freed from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain.”
{:#p8}

9\. After he taught this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This <em>sūtra</em> is a variant of the previous one (which is parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.99" target="_blank">SN 22.99</a>) and parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.100" target="_blank">SN 22.100</a>. The main feature of both this version and SN 22.100 is the metaphor of the dog tied to a post, which limits its range of movement. This metaphor is then used to illustrate how sentient beings are trapped in domains defined by the five aggregates until they escape rebirth. The P. version says the dog sits near the post, while this version uses an expression that means the dog orbits (turns around) the post.<br/>
The next metaphor, which asserts that diversity of form is the result of diversity of mind, uses the example of a colorful bird. The P. version is unclear whether the metaphor is about a bird or a painting, though the meaning is not impacted much by it. I discuss the language issues in the notes below. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} <em>I don’t see a single form as varied as a multi-colored bird, but its mind goes beyond that. … That animal’s form is diverse because its mind is diverse.</em> C. 我不見一色種種如斑色鳥，心復過是。⋯彼畜生心種種故，色種種。 P. <em>Diṭṭhaṁ vo, bhikkhave, caraṇaṁ nāma cittan”ti? … Tampi kho, bhikkhave, caraṇaṁ nāma cittaṁ citteneva cittitaṁ. Tenapi kho, bhikkhave, caraṇena cittena cittaññeva cittataraṁ.</em> The P. passage here is confusing since the word for both “mind” and “colorful” is P. <em>citta</em> (whereas, they are <em>citta</em> and <em>citra</em> respectively in S.). It does indicate that P. <em>caraṇa</em> is a proper name, but this term is also confusing because it can mean “conduct” or “painting.” The C. passage makes it clear what these words were intended to mean, or at least presents us with an interpretation that’s coherent. See the next note for more on the language issues involved. [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3} <em>cāraṇa bird.</em> C. 嗟蘭那鳥 (EMC. tsiă-lan-na + “bird” = G. <em>carana</em>?). In the P. passage, <em>cāraṇa</em> again appears to be a standalone noun meaning “colorful painting.” Here, however, it’s the name of a bird that apparently was quite colorful and looked like it was painted. I can’t help but notice a couple hints at what has happened here in my search for clues about it.<br/>
First, P./S. <em>vāraṇa</em> occurs in a few places in Pali and Sanskrit sources as a kind of bird. This word was at times confused with <em>cāraṇa</em> as evidenced by the variant reading in <cite>Therāgatha</cite> 19.1, where <em>vāraṇika</em> occurs as an alt. reading for <em>cāraṇika</em>.<br/>
Another consideration is that C. translators sometimes appended words like “country” or “bird” to Indic proper nouns as a interlineal comment for readers unfamiliar with foreign names. It may be that the original didn’t specify that <em>cāraṇa</em> was a bird, but the translator understood it as such.<br/>
Thus, the issue seems to be one of interpretation, but also possibly a case of words changing in pronunciation over time and becoming confused. The P. tradition may have forgotten that <em>cāraṇa</em> could be the name of a bird, and it wouldn’t be apparent to lexicographers if the usage was rare and the intended meaning was not indicated by context.
