### 1-4 (1). Impermanent, Painful, Empty, and Not Self

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You should observe that form is [1] impermanent … [2] painful … [3] empty … [4] not self. Observing it in this way is right view.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment. When someone is disillusioned, delight and greed end. When delight and greed end, I say one’s mind is liberated.
{:#p2}

3\. “Thus observe that feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is [1] impermanent … [2] painful … [3] empty … [4] not self. Observing it in this way is right view. Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment. When someone is disillusioned, delight and greed end. When delight and greed end, I say one’s mind is liberated.
{:#p3}

4\. “In this way, monks, someone who wants to realize the mind’s liberation for themselves can realize: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice[\[3\]](#n3){:#ref3} has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
{:#p4}

<em>Like “observe … impermanent,” “pain,” “emptiness,” and “not self” are taught in the same way.</em>

5\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} These four <em>sūtra</em>s (SĀ 1.1-4) are  <em>sūtra</em> no. 1 in the <cite>Taisho</em> edition (T99.2.1a6). Close Pali parallels include <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.12" target="_blank">SN 22.12</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.51" target="_blank">SN 22.51</a>.<br/>
These <em>sūtra</em>s follow the same template with the keywords “impermanent,” “painful,” “empty,” and “not self.” Compare these <em>sūtra</em>s with <a href="../02/SA2_1.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.1-4 (188)</a>, which apply the same template to the six sense fields (i.e., vision, hearing, smelling, taste, tactile feelings, and mental perceptions). This parallelism continues between SĀ 1.1-10 and SĀ 2.1-10.<br/>
The Chinese translators there employs clearer grammatical structures and vocabulary choices than they do here. E.g., 觀察 is clearer than 觀 for the meaning “to observe.” 正見 appear more correct than 正觀 when we compare these <em>sūtra</em>s with their Pali counterparts. And dependent clauses are used instead of topicalized subjects. Looking past these minor differences, the source texts appear to have been identical templates.<br/>
These stylistic differences indicate that either different translators worked on the project at different times, or perhaps there was a hiatus during which the same translator’s style changed. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} <em>right view</em>. Yinshun amends “correct observation” (正觀) to “right view” (正見) in this <em>sūtra</em>, citing the parallel passages at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.51" target="_blank">SN 22.51</a> and <a href="../02/SA2_1-4.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.1-4</a>. I’ve followed his suggestion here and below. [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3} <em>religious practice</em>. C. 梵行, G. <em>braṃmayiya</em>, P. <em>brahmacariya</em>, S. <em>brahmacarya</em>. This term is typically translated lit. to C. as “Brahma” (梵) “practice” (行). It usu. refers generally to living as a religious person toward a spiritual goal, but it also specifically meant the celebate life. This practice of celebacy is probably why it was called the “Brahma” practice: Buddhists held that sexuality and gender didn’t exist in the Brahma heavens and above (cf. <a href="../../dirgha/DA_30-8.html#p66" target="_blank">DĀ 30, Chapter 8</a>, where this topic is discussed). To practice celebacy was to emulate the gods above the desire realm. [\[back\]](#ref3)
