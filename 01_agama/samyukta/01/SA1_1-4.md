### 1-4 (1). Impermanent, Painful, Empty, and Not Self

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should observe that form is [1] impermanent … [2] painful … [3] empty … [4] not self. Observing it in this way is right view.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment. When someone is disillusioned, delight and greed end. When delight and greed end, I say their mind is liberated.
{: #p2}

3\. “Thus observe that feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is [1] impermanent … [2] painful … [3] empty … [4] not self. Observing it in this way is right view. Correctly observing it gives rise to disillusionment. When someone is disillusioned, delight and greed end. When delight and greed end, I say their mind is liberated.
{:#p3}

4\. “Thus, monks, someone who wants to realize the mind’s liberation for themselves can then realize: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
{:#p4}

5\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} Close parallels to this sūtra are [SN 22.12](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.12){:target="_blank"} and [SN 22.51](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.51){:target="_blank"}. The next three sūtras (SĀ 1.2-4) are variants that follow this template while substituting three other attributes (“painful,” “empty,” and “not self”) for “impermanent.” Compare this sūtra with [SĀ 2.1-4 (188)](../02/SA2_1.html){:target="_blank"}, which applies an identical template to the six senses. The Chinese translator there employs clearer grammatical structures and vocabulary choices (e.g., 觀察 to clarify that 觀 means “observe” instead of “contemplate,” 正見 instead of 正觀, and dependent clauses instead of nominalized subjects). [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} *right view*. Yinshun amends “correct observation” (正觀) to “right view” (正見) in this sūtra citing the parallel passages at [SN 22.51](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.51){:target="_blank"} and [SĀ 2.1](../02/SA2_1.html){:target="_blank"}. I’ve followed his suggestion here and below. [\[back\]](#ref2)
