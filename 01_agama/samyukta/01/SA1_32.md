<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 26 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 32 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0005c09" target="_blank">T99.2.5c9-19</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0035a10" target="_blank">Y30.35a10-36a2</a>). It, the previous, and the next three <em>sūtra</em>s are variants of <a href="SA1_29.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.29</a>-<a href="SA1_30.html" target="_blank">30</a> that feature anonymous monks who bring questions to the Buddha, rather than Rāhula. All five <em>sūtra</em>s comprise a separate chapter with their own <em>uddāna</em> verse and correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.115" target="_blank">SN 22.115</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.116" target="_blank">116</a>. While they each feature a question about a different expression used by the Buddha, his explanations all refer back to the same rubric of liberation from desire for the five aggregates. See the notes to <a href="SA1_31.html#n2" target="_blank">SĀ 1.31</a> for more about the definition of the Dharma teacher found below. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
