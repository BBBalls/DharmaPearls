<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 256 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 39 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0064b22" target="_blank">T99.2.64b22-c19</a>). It and the next two <em>sūtra</em>s correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.129" target="_blank">SN 22.129-135</a>, and their closest parallels are <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.133" target="_blank">SN 22.133-135</a>, which combine the definition of ignorance and insight into a single discourse. This particular <em>sūtra</em> doesn’t have a direct parallel but represents a variant of the same basic template. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
