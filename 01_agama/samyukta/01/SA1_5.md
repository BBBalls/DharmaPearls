### 5 (2). Correctly Contemplated

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should correctly contemplate form, observe that form is impermanent, and truly know it. Why is that? Monks, when someone correctly contemplates form, observes it to be impermanent, and truly knows it, they stop desire and greed for form. When someone stops desire and greed, I say their mind is liberated.
{:#p2}

3\. “Thus, one should correctly contemplate feeling … conception … volition … consciousness, observe that consciousness is impermanent, and truly know it. Why is that? When someone correctly contemplates consciousness, observes it to be impermanent, [and truly knows it], they stop desire and greed for consciousness. When someone stops desire and greed, I say their mind is liberated.
{:#p3}

4\. “Thus, someone who wants to realize the mind’s liberation for themselves can then realize: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
{:#p4}

5\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.52](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.52){:target="_blank"} and [SĀ 2.5](../02/sa2_5.html){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} The *Taisho* edition includes a note describing variant sūtras that’s identical to the one found in [SĀ 1.1](sa1_1.html){:target="_blank"}; however, these variants would be inconsistent with the summary verse at the end of [SĀ 1.10](sa1_10.html){:target="_blank"}, and the parallel sūtra at [SĀ 2.5](../02/sa2_5.html){:target="_blank"} doesn’t have these variants. I have followed Yinshun’s lead in ignoring this variant note. [\[back\]](#ref2)
