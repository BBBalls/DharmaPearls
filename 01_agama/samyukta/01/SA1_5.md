### 5. Correctly Contemplated

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You should correctly contemplate form, observe that form is impermanent, and truly know it. Why is that? Monks, when form is correctly contemplated, observed to be impermanent, and truly known, that stops desire and greed for form. When desire and greed [for form] are stopped, that’s said to be the mind’s liberation.
{:#p2}

3\. “Thus, you should correctly contemplate feeling … perception … volition … consciousness, observe that consciousness is impermanent, and truly know it. Why is that? When consciousness is correctly contemplated, observed to be impermanent, and truly known, that stops desire and greed for consciousness. When desire and greed [for consciousness] are stopped, that’s said to be the mind’s liberation.
{:#p3}

4\. “Thus, someone wanting to realize the mind's liberation for themselves then can realize it: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2}
{:#p4}

5\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p5}

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.52](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.52){:target="_blank"} and SĀ 2.5. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} The *Taisho* edition includes a note describing variant sūtras identical to the one found in SĀ 1.1; however, these variants would be inconsistent with the summary verse at the end of SĀ 1.10, and the parallel sūtra at SĀ 2.5 doesn’t have these variants. I have followed Yinshun’s lead in removing the note. [\[back\]](#ref2)
