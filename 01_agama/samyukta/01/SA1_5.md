### 5. Correctly Contemplated

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You must correctly contemplate form, observing that form is impermanent and knowing it as it really is. Why is that? Monks, when you correctly contemplate form, observing that form is impermanent and knowing it as it really is, it stops desire and greed for form. When desire and greed for it are stopped, that’s said to be the mind’s liberation.
{:#p2}

3\. “Thus, you must correctly contemplate feeling … perception … volition … consciousness, observing that consciousness is impermanent and knowing it as it really is. Why is that? When you correctly contemplate consciousness, observing that consciousness is impermanent and knowing it as it really is, it stops desire and greed for consciousness. When desire and greed for it are stopped, that’s said to be the mind’s liberation.
{:#p3}

4\. “Thus, if someone whose mind is liberated wants to realize it themselves, then they will realize this: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2}
{:#p4}

5\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught then rejoiced and approved.

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.52](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.52){:target="_blank"} and SĀ 2.5. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} The *Taisho* edition includes a note describing variant sūtra identical to the one found in SĀ 1.1; however, these variants would be inconsistent with the summary verse at the end of SĀ 1.10, and the parallel sūtra at SĀ 2.5 doesn’t have these variants. I have followed Yinshun’s lead in removing the note. [\[back\]](#ref2)
