Parting with desire for it, it ceases, becomes tranquil, and disappears. After knowing that all forms have been impermanent, painful, and liable to change since the distant past, those good sons will stop form when it’s the cause and condition giving rise to grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble. Having stopped it, they’ll attach to nothing. Being detached, they’ll live in well-being. Once they live in well-being, that’s called <em>nirvāṇa</em>. <em>Feelings, conceptions, volitions, and awareness are likewise.</em>”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 36 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 148 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0008a21" target="_blank">T99.2.8a21-b14</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.43" target="_blank">SN 22.43</a>. Note that the analysis of form differs from that of the Pali, and there’s no mention of sixteen monks. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Umbrella Mango Tree Park on the bank of the Bhadra River in Mathurā</em>. C. 摩偷羅國、跋提河側、傘蓋菴羅樹園. SN 22.43 is placed at Sāvatthī. Aside from Mathurā, a well-known city in western India, these place names are obscure and lack good attestation in other Buddhist sources that I can find. Below is an analysis of each location name in this introduction:<br/>
<em>Mathurā</em>. C. 摩偷羅國 (EMC. mua-t‘əu-la + “country” = Pr. <em>mathura</em> or <em>madhura</em>), P. <em>madhurā</em>, S. <em>mathurā</em>.<br/>
<em>on the bank of the Bhadrika River</em>. C. 跋提河側 (EMC. buat-dei + “river bank”). 跋提 was sometimes used to translit. the name of one of the five original disciples, Bhadrika. It could also translit. <em>vati</em>. The river that would have been near Mathurā was the Yamunā. Perhaps this was another name for it, or a minor river in the area. I can find no attestation of this river in other sources.<br/>
<em>Umbrella Mango Tree Park.</em> C. 傘蓋菴羅樹園 (EMC. “umbrella” + •əm-la (Pr. <em>amra</em>) + “tree” + “park”). There are a number of different grove names for Mathurā. In Theravāda sources, it was called Gundāvana (alternatively spelled Kundā-, Guṇḍā-, and Kuṇḍā-). We also find the name 頻陀林 (EMC. biĕn-da + “forest”) in 大悲經 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T12n0380_p0971c17" target="_blank">T380.12.971c17</a>), which would appear to translit. <em>binda</em> or <em>vinda</em>. In the <em>Sarvāstivāda Vinaya</em> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T23n1435_p0451a06" target="_blank">T1435.23451a6</a>), the forest was called 阿波大羅 (EMC. •a-pua-da-la), which is a translit. suggestive of words like S. <em>ānapatra</em>, which could mean umbrella. It would seem to be a detail added later, given the creative variations that we see across the board. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
