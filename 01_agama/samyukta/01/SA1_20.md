### 20 (14). Enjoyment (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “In the past, I had pursued and practiced the enjoyment of form. When I realized the enjoyment of form as a result,[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had pursued and practiced the enjoyment of feeling … conception … volition … consciousness. When I realized the enjoyment of feeling … conception … volition … consciousness as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, I pursued and practiced the trouble of form. When I realized form’s trouble as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I pursued and practiced the trouble of feeling … conception … volition … consciousness. When I realized the trouble of consciousness as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p3}

4\. “Monks, I pursued and practiced the escape from form. When I realized the escape from form as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I pursued and practiced the escape from feeling … conception … volition … consciousness. When I realized the escape from consciousness as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p4}

5\. “Monks, had I not truly known the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape, I wouldn’t be freed, escaped, and parted with them. I would have forever stood in delusion among gods like Māra or Brahmā,  ascetics and priests, or the assemblies of gods and humans, and I couldn’t have realized my attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.
{:#p5}

6\. “Monks, it’s because I truly knew the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape that I was freed, escaped, parted, and liberated from bondage. I never again stood in delusion among gods like Māra or Brahmā,  ascetics and priests, or the assemblies of gods and humans, and I could realize my attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.”
{:#p6}

7\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p7}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This <em>sūtra</em> is a variant of the previous one (<a href="SA1_17.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.19</em>). Both correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.26/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.26-28</a>, with this <em>sūtra</em> being closest to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.27/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.27</a>. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n1} <em>realized … as a result</em>. Ch. 隨順覺. The parallel word in SN 22.27 is P. <em>tadajjhagama</em> (“found that”), which combines a relative pronoun with a form of P. <em>adhigacchati</em>. The C. appears to translate a different word in Prakrit that meant something like “consequently realized.” Of course, “realized” in the sense of discovering something is similar to the “found” meaning that P. <em>adhigacchati</em> can have. I wonder if the Prakrit here might have been equiv. to <em>anugacchati</em>. It would explain the prefix 隨順, which sometimes translates <em>anu-</em> in Indic words. While S. <em>gacchati</em> has meanings like the P. word (“to go, obtain, pass away”), it can also mean “to understand” or “perceive,” which matches 覺 much better. [\[back\]](#ref1)
