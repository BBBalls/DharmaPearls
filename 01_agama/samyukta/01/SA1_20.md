### 20. Enjoyment (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “In the past, I had pursuits and practices of enjoying form. When as a result I realized[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} the enjoyment of form, then I truly saw it with wisdom.  Thus, I had pursuits and practices of enjoying feeling … perception … volition … consciousness. When as a result I realized the enjoyment of feeling … perception … volition … consciousness, then I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, I had the pursuits and practices of form’s trouble. When as a result I realized form’s trouble, then I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had the pursuits and practices of feeling’s … perception’s … volition’s … consciousness’s trouble. When as a result I realized consciousness’s trouble, then I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p3}

4\. “Monks, I had the pursuits and practices of escaping form. When as a result I realized the escape from form, then I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had the pursuits and practices of escaping feeling … perception … volition … consciousness. When as a result I realized the escape from consciousness, then I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p4}

5\. “Monks, had I not truly known the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape, then I wouldn’t have been freed, parted, and exited, and I would have forever stood in delusion among gods like Māra or Brahma and ascetics, priests, gods, and human assemblies. Nor could I have realized for myself attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.
{:#p6}

6\. “Monks, I did truly know the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape. I was freed, parted, and exited, and I never again stood in delusion among gods like Māra or Brahma and ascetics, priests, gods, and human assemblies. I could also realize for myself attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.”
{:#p6}

7\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p7}
