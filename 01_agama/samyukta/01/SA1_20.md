### 20 (14). Enjoyment (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “In the past, I had pursuits and practices of enjoying form. When I realized[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} the enjoyment of form as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had pursuits and practices of enjoying feeling … conception … volition … consciousness. When I realized the enjoyment of feeling … conception … volition … consciousness as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, I had the pursuits and practices of form’s trouble. When I realized form’s trouble as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had the pursuits and practices of feeling’s … conception’s … volition’s … consciousness’s trouble. When I realized consciousness’s trouble as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p3}

4\. “Monks, I had the pursuits and practices of escaping form. When I realized the escape from form as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had the pursuits and practices of escaping feeling … conception … volition … consciousness. When I realized the escape from consciousness as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.
{:#p4}

5\. “Monks, had I not truly known the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape, I wouldn’t be freed from, parted with, and escaped from [bondage]. I would have forever stood in delusion among the gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests in the assemblies of gods and humans, and I couldn’t have realized my attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.
{:#p5}

6\. “Monks, I did truly know the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape, and I was freed from, parted with, and escaped from [bondage]. I never again stood in delusion among the gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests in the assemblies of gods and humans, and I could realize my attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.”
{:#p6}

7\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p7}
