    <td title='t99.2.3c29'>爾時，有異比丘從坐起。 偏袒右肩，為佛作禮，却住一面。 而白佛言： 「善哉，世尊，為我略說法要。 我聞法已，當獨一靜處，專精思惟，不放逸住⋯乃至⋯ 『「自知不受後有。」』」</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat. He adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder, bowed to the Buddha, and withdrew to stand at one side. He then said to the Buddha, “It would be good, Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … <em>up to</em> … ‘“I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”</td>

Having listened to the Dharma, I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … <em>up to</em> … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”’ [Is this what you said?]”</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. The Buddha addressed the monk, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. If something doesn’t belong to you and it doesn’t belong to someone else, then this is something to get rid of quickly. Once you’ve gotten rid of that thing, you will be benefited by this doctrine, and you’ll find happiness for a long time.”</td>

<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 18 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 24 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0003c28" target="_blank">T99.2.3c28-4b27</a>). It’s a variant of the previous <em>sūtra</em> (<a href="SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a>), and it has a close parallel in Pali at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.34" target="_blank">SN 22.34</a>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33" target="_blank">SN 22.33</a> uses the same template but includes a simile not found here. The next two <em>sūtra</em>s are variants that substitute different principles for the monk to contemplate. See <a href="SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a> for the full passages that were abbreviated here. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
