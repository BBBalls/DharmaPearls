Ānanda told the Buddha, “If a mendicant from another religion were to come and asked me, ‘Ānanda, why does the Bhagavān instruct people to cultivate religious practices?’ I would answer: ‘The Bhagavān instructs people to cultivate religious practices so that they will cultivate disillusionment with form, part with desire for it, completely cease it, be freed from it, and for it not to arise. He instructs people to cultivate religious practices so that they will cultivate disillusionment with feeling … conception … volition … awareness, part with desire for it, completely cease it, be freed from it, and for it not to arise.’ Bhagavān, if a mendicant from another religion were to question me thus, I would answer them in this way.”</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. The Buddha told Ānanda, “Good, good! You should answer in this way. Why is that? I really do instruct people to cultivate religious practices so that they will cultivate disillusionment with form, part with desire for it, completely cease it, be freed from it, and for it not to arise. I instruct people to cultivate religious practices so that they will cultivate disillusionment with feeling … conception … volition … awareness, part with desire for it, completely cease it, be freed from it, and for it not to arise.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 50 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 162 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0012b10" target="_blank">T99.2.12b10-24</a>). It begins with the same premise as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.37" target="_blank">SN 22.37</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.38" target="_blank">38</a> and <a href="SA1_161.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.161</a>, where the Buddha asks Ānanda how he would respond to a question. However, the rest of this <em>sūtra</em> is different aside from the basic point that disillusionment with the five aggregates leads to liberation. By contrast, SN 22.38 is a simpler variant that superficially triples the size of SN 22.37 by asking and answering the same question in terms of past, future, and present. We should probably regard this <em>sūtra</em> as a third variant that wasn’t preserved in Pali. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
