He had a good understanding of various philosophies and was proud of his erudition. He had a nuanced knowledge about the philosophies that he had broadly collected, having entered their minute details. He taught Dharma for an assembly which went beyond that of other philosophers. He often had the thought, “No ascetic or priest is a match for me. I could even debate the Tathāgata! When the philosophers hear my name, their foreheads drip, their armpits become wet, and sweat flows from their hair pores. The wind of my doctrine blows down grass and knocks down trees, breaks up metal and stone, and subdues <em>nāga</em> elephants. How could any human philosopher  face me?”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 110 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 178 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0035a17" target="_blank">T99.2.35a17-7b27</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn35" target="_blank">MN 35</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ea37.10" target="_blank">EĀ 37.10</a>.<br/>
While this version and MN 35 bear a strong resemblance to each other, EĀ 37.10 represents a somewhat different debate. There, the argument centers around whether form is permanent or impermanent, not whether it is self or not self. The Buddha uses the example of a wheel-turning king being subject to mortality even though he is an absolute sovereign to convince Satyaka of his error. Otherwise, the general events of the stories are the same, indicating perhaps that the debate portion has been heavily redacted by later sectarian authors. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Monkey Pond.</em> C. 獼猴池, P. <em>makkaṭa rahada</em>?, S. <em>markaṭa hrada</em>. The C. is a lit. trans. meaning “monkey pond.” This was a location near Vaiśālī attested in S. sources but apparently not found in P. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>a Jain disciple</em>. C. 尼揵子 (EMC. nei-gɪɛn + “son” = Pr. <em>nigan[tha]-putra</em>), G. <em>nigaṭ́haputra</em>, P. <em>nigaṇṭhaputta</em>, S. <em>nirgranthaputra</em>. Nirgranthajñāniputra was the founder of the religion that is today known as Jain. I’ve used this modern name for clarity. The C. lit. means “disciple of Nirgrantha.” In P. sources, MN 35 is apparently the only place this term occurs, and it’s interpreted in commentary to mean the son of Jain disciples. However, the term clearly means a Jain disciple in other passages in SĀ (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0231b01" target="_blank">T99.2.231b1</a> and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0231b01" target="_blank">371a27</a>). [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>Aśvajit.</em> C. 阿濕波誓 (EMC. •a-ʃiəp-pua-ʒɪɛi = P. <em>aśpaji</em> or <em>aśvaji</em>), G. <em>*aśpaji</em>, P. <em>assaji</em>, S. <em>aśvajit</em>. The C. translit. matches the G. and S. pronunciations better than P. I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5"><em>Satyaka.</em> C. 薩遮 (EMC. sat-tʃɪă = Pr. <em>saca</em>), G. <em>sacaga</em>, P. <em>saccaka</em>, S. <em>satyaka</em>. The C. translit. matches the G. and P. pronunciations best. I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>Agnivaiśyāyana.</em> C. 火種居士, G. <em>*agiveśiya</em>, P. <em>aggivessana</em>, S. <em>agnivaiśyāyana</em>. The C. translates Satyaka’s surname as “fire element householder.” This could be reverse-translated as G. <em>*agiveśiya</em>. In S. sources, <em>veśiya</em> apparently became <em>vaiśyāyana</em>, which would mean something like “coming from the tradesman class” (<em>vaiśya-ayana</em>). The P. equiv. was <em>vessana</em>, but it’s not clear to me what that term’s original meaning might have been. I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n7"><em>Licchavis.</em> C. 離車 (EMC. lɪĕ-tʃ‘ɪă), G. <em>lichavi</em>, P. <em>licchavi</em>, S. <em>licchavi</em>. This was the name of the warrior (i.e., S. <em>kṣatriya</em>) tribe that lived in the vicinity of Vaiśālī. This well-known C. translit. matches the G. pronunciation as well as the P. and S. (but drops the final syllable as usu.). I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n8">In the P. version, Sacchaka uses four metaphors that are somewhat different: manhandling a sheep, a brewer washing a seive in a lake, a brewer manipulating a strainer, and washing a bull elephant’s ears.<br/>
In EĀ 37.10, he employs three metaphors: manhandling a sheep, a fierce elephant playing in a deep pond, and a pair of strong men grabbing a weak man and putting him on a bed of hot coals. That version ends quite dramatically with Satyaka claiming he’ll beat Gautama so bad he’ll bleed from his face and die (!).<br/>
We can see, though, that at least the example of an elephant must date back to some older version that all three had in common. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n9"><em>This is a good time for it.</em> C. 宜知是時, P. <em>paṭibhātu taṁ</em>. The C. lit. means “know that this is a fitting time.” It likely translates an expression more like S. <em>ayaṃ kālaḥ</em> rather than the P. parallel, which sounds more literary (“A parable occurs to me.” “And what is it that occurs to you?”). Given that these are conversational idioms, I’ve translated the expression with something that would be more natural to an English speaker today. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n10"><em>form in this way is a person’s self that’s born from good and evil.</em> C. 如是色是我人，善惡從生, P. <em>evameva kho, bho gotama, rūpattāyaṁ purisapuggalo rūpe patiṭṭhāya puññaṁ vā apuññaṁ vā pasavati</em>. In the P. parallel, <em>rūpa</em> is restated as the subject of <em>pasavati</em>, meaning that it is what creates good and evil. Physical and verbal actions were considered forms, so this might refer to deeds rather than a person’s body, though both are reasonable readings.<br/>
In the C., the subject for 生 is left understood, leaving it open to be read as either form or the person as the creator of good and evil. The natural reading is to carry the subject from the previous clause forward, meaning that 色 is the subject again. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n11"><em>Yes, Gautama. Form is a person’s self.</em> C. 如是，瞿曇。色是我人, P. <em>Ahañhi, bho gotama, evaṁ vadāmi: ‘rūpaṁ me attā</em>. In the P. parallel, there is a rhetorical equation between <em>purisapuggala</em> (“a man’s person”) and the pronoun <em>me</em> (“me, my”) that doesn’t happen here in the C. This is of interest because among Buddhists there was a rejection of the concept of <em>pudgala</em> as a substitute for S. <em>atma</em>.<br/>
In both cases, this argument would appear to be commenting on something other than Jain philosophy, since among Jains <em>pudgala</em> meant matter in general and was a synonym of <em>rūpa</em> among Buddhists. It is not given the specific meaning of a person in extant Jain texts. Jains, like Buddhists, held that the corporeal existence was a problem from which the practitioner needed to be liberated, so it makes little sense that a Jain disciple is depicted as identifying it with the soul or self. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n12"><em>vajra warrior</em> yakṣa. C. 金剛力鬼神, P. <em>vajirapāṇi yakkha</em>. The usu. C. translation is 力士 (“strong man” or “warrior”), and an alt. reading adds 士 here. This character makes similar appearances in other debate <em>sūtra</em>s in which an opponent refuses to admit that the Buddha is correct. The threat of having one’s head split in seven pieces became a repeated trope not always associated with this spirit, but the threat is never carried out. It served to overcome a man’s pride when it prevents him from admitting that he is wrong.<br/>
In the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite>, this spirit is called 密迹力士 (“concealed tracks warrior”), where 密迹 likely translated S. <em>guhyaka</em> or <em>guhyapāda</em>. <em>Guhyaka</em> appear to be a class of <em>yakṣa</em> spirits in the service of the god king Vaiśravaṇa in some Buddhist myths. S. <em>vajrapāṇi</em> in that case is an epithet or dscription of this guardian spirit rather than his name, as it does here. It seems that this epithet became the spirit’s name in P. sources.

<li id="n13">At this point, MN 35 appears to equate the five aggregates to suffering directly, whereas here it is desire for them that brings about suffering, which is more consistent with other EBTs. [<a href="#ref13">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n14">This metaphor is missing from MN 35, perhaps because it depicts the aggregates (the child) as being one thing and a person (the man) as something else. Again, it’s attachment that creates suffering in this argument. [<a href="#ref14">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n15"><em>Durmukha.</em> C. 突目佉 (EMC. duət-mɪuk-k‘ɪo = Pr. <em>*dumukho</em>), P. <em>dummukha</em>, S. <em>durmukha</em>. The C. translit. matches P. best, the G. equiv. is unclear to me; there is no attestation extant. The name meant “ugly face,” perhaps equiv. to English “horse face,” but with connotations for being evil. This character appears only in this story in Pali sources, though there is also a tale about a king by this name who became a <em>pacceka buddha</em> in the Jātakas (cf. <a href="https://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/d/dummukha.htm" target="_blank">Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</a>). I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. [<a href="#ref15">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n16"><em>scoop</em>. C. 斗斛. The C. expression can be a vernacular for taking enough for a meal, but the words were also used as larger units of measure for the accounting of grain transactions. 斗 was a peck, or about two liters of grain, while a 斛 was ten pecks. In Buddhist translations, 斛 was used sometimes to translate S. <em>droṇa</em>, which was around ten kilograms of grain. Of course, these units of measure were not well standardized in ancient times and varied from locality to locality and over time. Here, I do not think that was the intent. The terms are used to contrast a small amount vs. a very large one as a metaphor for the relative eloquence of Satyaka vs. the Buddha. [<a href="#ref16">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n17"><em>unsurpassed in knowledge, unsurpassed in in the path, and unsurpassed in liberation.</em> C. 智無上、道無上、解脫無上, P. <em>dassanānuttariyena, paṭipadānuttariyena, vimuttānuttariyena</em>. The Taisho version reads 智無上、解脫無上、解脫知見無上 (“unsurpassed in knowledge, unsurpassed in liberation, and unsurpassed in knowing and seeing liberation”). However, there are two alternate readings that would restore the list to something closer to what we find in MN 35: 智無上、道無上、解脫無上.<br/>
There is a parallel version of this list in the <cite>Saṃgītiparyāya</cite> by Xuanzang (T1536.26.390c29): 三無上者：一、行無上，二、智無上，三、解脫無上 (“The three ways of being unsurpassed: Unsurpassed in practice, unsurpassed in knowledge, and unsurpassed in liberation”). Another is found in Sthiramati’s <cite>Abhidharma-samuccaya-vyākhyā</cite> (T1606.31.727a17): 無上有三種：謂智無上、行無上、解脫無上 (“There are three ways of being unsurpassed: Unsurpassed in knowledge, unsurpassed in practice, and unsurpassed in liberation”).<br/>
The difference between this version and the Theravāda version is the substitution of “knowledge” for “seeing” and “path” for “practice.” 道 is is possibly an alt. translation of S. <em>pratipad</em>, and knowledge is a close synonym of seeing in Buddhist language. I’ve adopted the alt. C. reading, but I do wonder what the source was for the Taisho version of the list. [<a href="#ref17">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n18">This list of the seven shrines of Vaiśālī has a couple parallels, which usu. number six or four. One group of parallels is found in some accounts of the Buddha going to Cāpāla Shrine and telling Ānanda about the fact that a <em>buddha</em> could live for an eon. In some versions of this story, namely in DN 16, Taisho 7, and <cite>Divyāvadāna</cite> no. 17, the Buddha first extols Vaiśālī and recites a list of six shrines. This doesn’t happen in other versions of the story, however, such as in DĀ 2 or the <cite>Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya</cite>.<br/>
Two other parallels are found in a passage shared by DN 24 and DĀ 15 that lists four shrines of Vaiśālī. These two lists overlap with the larger lists.<br/>
When I compare this list of seven shrines here in SĀ 1.178 to these parallels, I notice that it agrees best with the one found in the <cite>Divyāvadāna</cite>, which is helpful in interpreting the C. in a couple cases. Below is an analysis of each C. name found in the present passage:<br/>
<em>Cāpāla Shrine.</em> C. 遮波梨支提 (EMC. tʃɪă-pua-lɪi tʃɪĕ-dei = G. <em>capala cedi[ya]</em>), P. <em>cāpāla cetiya</em>, S. <em>cāpāla caitya</em>. The translit. sounds out <em>capali</em>. Given that all other sources agree on <em>cāpāla</em>, I assume this is a corruption in our text (i.e., 梨 perhaps should read 羅). This shrine figures prominently in all versions of the story of the Buddha encountering Māra and Ānanda missing his hint about living longer.<br/>
<em>Saptārmaka Shrine.</em> 漆菴羅樹支提 (EMC. “seven” + •əm-la + “tree” + tʃɪĕ-dei = G. *<em>sataṃbra cedi[ya]</em>), P. <em>sattambaka cetiya</em>, S. <em>saptāmraka caitya</em>. Both the P. and S. names lit. mean “seven mango trees” (S. <em>sapta-āmraka</em>). C. 漆 lit. means “lacquer,” but it also happens to be an alternate form of 七 (“seven”).<br/>
<em>Bahuputraka Shrine</em>. C. 多子支提 (EMC. “many sons” + tʃɪĕ-dei = G. *<em>bahuputra cedi[ya]</em>), P. <em>bahuputta cetiya</em>, S. <em>bahuputraka caitya</em>. This shrine is the north shrine in DN 24 and the west shrine in DĀ 15.<br/>
<em>Gautamanyagrodha Shrine.</em> C. 瞿曇在(=尼?)拘樓陀支提 (EMC. gɪu-dəm nei-kiu-ləu-da tʃɪĕ-dei = G. *<em>Godama nigrodha(?) cedi[ya]</em>), P. <em>gotamaka</em>, S. <em>gautamanyagrodha</em>. I’ve ammended 在 to 尼 in light of the S. parallels, which pair <em>gautama</em> with <em>nyagrodha</em>. Otherwise, the pronunciation would be EMC. dzəi-kiu-ləu-da = <em>jigrodha</em>. Taisho 7 agrees with the P.: 瞿曇 is EMC. gɪu-dəm = G. <em>godam[a]</em>. This is the south shrine in DN 24, but it doesn’t occur in DĀ 15.<br/>
<em>Sālavrata Shrine.</em> C. 娑羅受持支提 (EMC. sa-la + “keep” + tʃɪĕ-dei = G. <em>salavada? cedi[ya]</em>), P. <em>sārandada</em>?, S. <em>sālavrata</em> (or <em>śālavana</em>). This shrine’s name appears to have suffered from quite a bit of confusion. The two S. versions are quite different, and the P. does not agree with either, but all three begin with a similar pronunciation (remembering that <em>-r-</em> and <em>-l-</em> can alternate between dialects). The C. translates the second part of the word as 受持, which could match S. <em>vrata</em> (“observance”). The Taisho 7 parallel lends us no help in deciphering this, as it is only a translit. of <em>sala</em> or <em>sara</em>. Since the present passage has matched the S. parallels better in the other cases, I’ve opted for S. <em>sālavrata</em>, but it is only tentative.<br/>
<em>Dhuranikṣepana</em>. C. 捨重擔支提 (EMC. “discarded heavy burden” + tʃɪĕ-dei = BHS. <em>dhuranikṣepana cedi[ya]</em>) P. ?, S. <em>dhuranikṣepana caitya</em>. Analayo reconstructs this shrine’s name as P. <em>dhurānikkhepana</em> based on a parallel found in a S. fragment that names a shrine S. <em>dhurānikṣepaṇa</em>. However, P. <em>dhur<strong>ā</strong>nikkhepana</em> presumably represents the compound S. <em>dhura-anikkhepana</em>, which would mean “heavy burden not set down.” The <cite>Divyāvadāna</cite> parallel has instead S. <em>dhuranikṣepana</em>, which makes better sense.<br/>
<em>Mallamakuṭa Shrine.</em> C. 力士寶冠支提 (EMC. “precious crest of warriors” +  tʃɪĕ-dei = BHS. <em>mallamakuṭa cedi[ya]</em>), S. <em>mallānāṃ makuṭabandhana caitya</em>. The <cite>Divyāvadāna</cite> parallel for this shrine’s name makes it clear that 力士 (“strong man”) is a translation of S. <em>malla</em>. 寶冠 would render S. <em>makuṭa</em> well enough. Rotman (<cite>Divine Stories</cite>, Vol. I, p.337) translates the S. as “Tying a Crest Shrine of the Mallas,” but the C. lacks a verb like S. <em>bandhana</em>, so we can dispense with the awkward “tying.” [<a href="#ref18">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n19"><em>Vedic scriptures</em>. C. 闈陀經典. The translit. 闈陀 (EMC. ɦɪuəi-da = Pr. <em>veda</em>) presumably means the Vedas of Brahmanism. The whole expression 闈陀經典 probably corresponds to S. <em>vedavacana</em>.<br/>
<em>Sāvitrī.</em> C. 婆毘諦 (EMC. bua-bii-tei = Pr. <em>bhavite</em>?). A tempting alternate reading is 娑毘諦 (EMC sa-bii-tei), which could yield Pr. <em>saviti</em>, which would likely correspond to S. <em>sāvitrī</em>. This was a hymn taken from the <cite>Ṛgveda</cite> that’s attested to have been recited frequently by Brahmins. [<a href="#ref19">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n20">This is one of the few cases of an Āgama <em>sūtra</em> that lacks the standard intro or outro that signals the beginning and ending of a text. In some cases, it seems to be the result of texts being composed in a later era than the rest of the compilation, being set in a time after the Buddha’s <em>parinirvāṇa</em>. That’s not the case here, but I do wonder if the pattern still applies and this straying from the format of the old oral tradition signals that this is a later composition. [<a href="#ref20">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n21"><em>Pāṭala’s ten questions</em>. C. 彼多羅十問. This <em>sūtra</em> is missing from SĀ. The Taisho editors considered it a lost parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn42.13" target="_blank">SN 42.13</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ma20" target="_blank">MĀ 20</a>. If so, then pɪĕ-ta-la (彼多羅) would translit. Pr. <em>patala</em> (G. <em>padala</em>?, S. <em>pāṭala</em>?), which would presumably be equiv. to P. <em>pāṭaliya</em>.<br/>
<em>Kṣema</em>. C. 差摩 (EMC. ṭṣ‘ïĕ-mua = G/S. <em>kṣema</em>).<br/>
<em>Yamaka</em>. C. 焔[摩迦] (EMC. yiɛm-mua-kă = G. <em>yamaka</em>). Yamaka’s name has been shortened to the first character (“ya”) of the translit. found in <a href="SA1_172.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.172</a>, presumably to fit the fixed length of the <em>uddāna</em> verse.<br/>
<em>Sainya</em>. C. 仙尼 (siɛn-ṇɪi = G. <em>seni[ya]</em>). This translit. likely was equiv. to G/P. <em>seniya</em> (S. <em>sainya</em>). The final syllable has been dropped.<br/>
<em>Anurādha</em>. C. 阿㝹羅 (EMC. •a-nu?-la = Pr. <em>anura[dha]</em>), P/S. <em>anurādha</em>. Again, assuming a final syllable was dropped, this translit. fits the P/S. name found in this <em>sūtra</em>’s parallel. [<a href="#ref21">back</a>]</li>
