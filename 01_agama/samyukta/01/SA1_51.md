    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Take the example of a river produced by a mountain torrent. Its water is deep and fast moving. The current flows violently, and many things bob up and down in it. Both shores of that river have a mixture of reeds and trees growing on them. They form a bridge that leans across that large river from its shores. When a group of people attempt to ford the river there, many are carried away by the water, following the current until they disappear. When a wave pushes them near the shore, they grab at the reeds and trees, but the reeds and trees break, and they continue floating down the river.</td>

In the same way, they don’t truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness … the formation of awareness … cessation of awareness, enjoyment of awareness, trouble of awareness … don’t truly know the escape from awareness. Because they don’t truly know it, they delight in awareness. They say, ‘Awareness is myself.’ That awareness will also subsequently break.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 268 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 51 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0070a12" target="_blank">T99.2.70a12-29</a>). The parallel for this <em>sūtra</em> is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.93" target="_blank">SN 22.93</a>. Both versions feature a parable in which people who are washed away by a swift current fail to rescue themselves because they try to grab things along the shore that aren’t reliable and break. This is likened to the impermanence of the aggregates, which inevitable break up at the end of a person’s life. The main difference between the two versions is that the C. version analyzes the aggregates in terms of their formation, cessation enjoyment, trouble, and escape, while the P. version focuses on mistaking them as self.
