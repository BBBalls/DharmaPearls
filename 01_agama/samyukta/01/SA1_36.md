He went to Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa and visited Venerable Śāriputra there. Once they had exchanged greetings and asked how they were doing, he withdrew to sit at one side. He said to Śāriputra, “Suppose ascetics and priests say this, despite the impermanence, change, and insecurity of form: ‘I am better,’ ‘I am equal,’ or ‘I am inferior.’ Why would an ascetic or priest conceive of this, not seeing truly?

Śroṇa then saw and attained the Dharma, and he became confident in the correct Dharma without relying on someone else. He rose from his seat, adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder, and crouched with his palms together. He said to Śāriputra, “I’ve been freed today! From this day on, I take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the Saṅgha as a layman. From today until the end of my life, I will be pure in my devotion to these three jewels.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 30 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 36 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0006a24" target="_blank">T99.2.6a24-c3</a>). It’s parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.49" target="_blank">SN 22.49</a> and a Sanskrit fragment (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sf89/san/vallee" target="_blank">SF 89</a>). The discourse presented by these parallels is essentially the same, but here and in the S. fragment, it’s taught by Śāriputra rather than by the Buddha.<br/>
The next two <em>sūtra</em> are variants of this one. In the <a href="SA1_37.html" target="_blank">next <em>sūtra</em></a>, Śāriputra gives Śroṇa a teaching that analyzes the aggregates along the lines of the four truths (e.g., form, its formation, its cessation, and the path to its cessation). In <a href="SA1_38.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.38</a>, the path to cessation is replaced with enjoyment, trouble, and escape. In both variants, the argument found here about the impermanence, painfulness, and selflessness of the aggregates is repeated as well. Thus, the variation in both cases is to replace of Śroṇa’s initial question with a brief teaching by Śāriputra. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>

The C. translit. includes the <em>-r-</em> sound, so it appears to match the usu. S. pronunciation that’s also found in a G. attestation. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
