    <td id='p1'>1. Thus I have heard:<sup id="ref1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</td>

    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān put on his robe and took his bowl into Śrāvastī to solicit alms. He returned carrying his robe and bowl, but he didn’t speak to the assembly or address his attendant. He went alone and without another to the western lands and toured among the people there.</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.13c10'>時，安陀林中有一比丘遙見世尊不語眾，不告侍者，獨一無二。 見已，進詣尊者阿難所，白阿難言： 「尊者，當知世尊不語眾，不告侍者，獨一無二而出遊行。」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. At the time, there was a monk in Andha Forest who saw the Bhagavān from afar as he left alone without speaking to the assembly or addressing his attendant. Seeing that, he proceeded to visit Venerable Ānanda and said to him, “Venerable, you should know that the Bhagavān left alone to go touring without speaking to the assembly or addressing his attendant.”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.13c14'>爾時，阿難語彼比丘： 「若使世尊不語眾，不告侍者，獨一無二而出遊行，不應隨從。 所以者何？ 今日世尊欲住寂滅滅、少事故。」</td>
    <td id='p4'>4. Then, Ānanda said to that monk, “If the Bhagavān left alone to go touring without speaking to the assembly or addressing his attendant, then he shouldn’t be followed. Why is that? Because the Bhagavān wishes today to live in peace with few duties.”</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.13c17'>爾時，世尊遊行北至半闍國、波陀聚落。 於人所守護林中，住一跋陀薩羅樹下。 時，有眾多比丘詣阿難所，語阿難言： 「今聞世尊住在何所？」</td>
    <td id='p5'>5. Then, the Bhagavān wandered north to the village of Pada in Pañcāla. He stayed under a good sal tree in a forest that was guarded by wardens. Then, a group of monks went to Ānanda and said to him, “Have you heard lately where the Bhagavān is?”</td>

    <td id='p6'>6. Then, the monks said to Ānanda, “Venerable, you must know that we haven’t seen the Bhagavān for a long time. If people weren’t troublesome, they could go together to visit the Bhagavān because he is merciful.” Knowing it was time, Ānanda silently assented.</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.13c25'>爾時，尊者阿難與眾多比丘夜過晨朝。 著衣持鉢，入舍衛城乞食。 乞食已，還精舍，舉臥具，持衣鉢，出至西方人間遊行。 北至半闍國、波陀聚落、人守護林中。 時，尊者阿難與眾多比丘置衣鉢、洗足已，詣世尊所，頭面禮足，於一面坐。</td>
    <td id='p7'>7. Then, Venerable Ānanda and that group of monks rose early in the morning after the night had passed. They put on their robes and took their bowls into Śrāvastī to solicit alms. After soliciting alms, they returned to the monastery, put away their bedding, took their bowls, and headed west to tour among the people. They then went north to the village of Pada in Pañcāla and stayed in that forest that was protected by wardens. Once they had put away their robes and bowls and washed their feet, Venerable Ānanda and the group of monks then went to the Bhagavān, bowed their heads at his feet, and sat to one side.</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.14a1'>爾時，世尊為眾多比丘說法，示、教、利、喜。</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.14a3'>爾時，世尊知彼比丘心之所念，告諸比丘： 「若有比丘於此座中作是念： 『云何知、云何見疾得漏盡？』者，我已說法言： 『當善觀察諸陰， 所謂四念處、四正勤、四如意足、五根、五力、七覺分、八聖道分。』 我已說如是法，觀察諸陰。</td>
    <td id='p10'>10. Then, the Bhagavān knew the thought in that monk’s mind. “If there’s a monk sitting here who is thinking, ‘By knowing what and seeing what does one swiftly put an end to the contaminants,’ I have taught this Dharma. I said, ‘One must observe the aggregates. That is to say, the four abodes of mindfulness, four right efforts, four psychic abilities, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of awakening, and eight factors of the noble path.’ After being taught the Dharma in this way, one then observes the aggregates.</td>

    <td id='p11'>11. “But now there is still a good son who doesn’t diligently wish to do this, doesn’t diligently enjoy it, doesn’t diligently remember it, and doesn’t diligently believe it, but he is proud of himself. He’s unable to advance and put an end to the contaminants. If, again, a good son observes the aggregates with this Dharma I’ve taught, diligently desires to do so, diligently enjoys it, diligently remembers it, and diligently believes it, he can swiftly put an end to the contaminants.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 57 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 169 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0013c07" target="_blank">T99.2.13c7-14b11</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81" target="_blank">SN 22.81</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, this version of the <em>sūtra</em> is simpler and less verbose than SN 22.81. It mentions the views of termination and existence without defining them, which would correspond to annihilationism and eternalism. SN 22.81 ends with doubt and uncertainty instead of self pride. It also lacks the conclusion found here.</p>
<p>Finally, SN 22.81 connects its backstory to the incident at Kosambī when the Buddha abandoned the monks because they were squabbling with each other. The present version doesn’t do this and locates the <em>sūtra</em> at Śrāvastī instead of Kosambī. One detail that the two backstories share, however, is that the Buddha arrives at a “good sal tree” (C. 跋陀薩羅樹, P. <em>bhaddasālamūla</em>). There may have been an original story with this feature that has changed quite a bit. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>contact, feeling, craving, and action</em>. C. 觸⋯受⋯行⋯愛. Yinshun points out that this order is incorrect: action should be last to reproduce the reverse order of the previous passage. I’ve followed his suggest to amend the passage to 觸⋯受⋯愛⋯行. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>makes views of termination and erodes views of existence</em>. C. 作斷見、壞有見. In SN 22.81, two specific views are mentioned that may well be expanded definitions of these two views here. “The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable” (<em>so attā so loko, so pecca bhavissāmi nicco dhuvo sassato avipariṇāmadhammo</em>) would be equivalent to “views of existence” here. “I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine” (<em>no cassaṁ no ca me siyā nābhavissaṁ na me bhavissatī</em>) would be equivalent to “views of termination” here. Traditionally, these two views refer to the view that a person is not reborn after death (“annihilationism”) and the view that a person has an eternal existence after this life (“eternalism”).
