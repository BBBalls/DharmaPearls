<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 263 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 46 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0067a22" target="_blank">T99.2.67a22-c3</a>). It’s remarkably similar to both <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.101" target="_blank">SN 22.101</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.71" target="_blank">AN 7.71</a>. It contains the same lesson that liberation occurs naturally as a result of training and the same three illustrating similes of a brooding hen, a workman’s axe handle, and a seafaring ship. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Citra the cowherd’s village in Kuru</em>. C. 拘留國雜色牧牛聚落. P/S. <em>kuru</em> is translit. as 拘留 (EMC. kɪu-lɪəu), and 國 indicates that it’s the name of a country. S. Citra (P. Citta) has been translated as 雜色 (lit. “variously colored”), who is identified as a cowherd (牧牛, lit. “pasturer of cattle”). Finally, 聚落 is the term for a village or hamlet. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>a brooding hen that lays a clutch of eggs</em>. C. 伏鷄生子眾多. 伏 has a contextual meaning when used with birds to mean brooding eggs (presumably because birds look like they are hiding their eggs when they sit on the nest). 生子 lit. means to give birth to offspring, but a chicken lays eggs rather than giving birth to live young. I’ve translated the expression assuming it means laying eggs. Otherwise, it might be intended to mean hatching her chicks from the eggs, which Buddhists considered to be a form of birth. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>a mason</em>. C. 巧師. P/S. <em>palagaṇḍa</em>. The C. translation 巧師 appears to be a corruption, or at least an obscure reading. Lit. 巧師 means only “skilled artisan,” if we read 師 to mean a professional of some kind. However, a similar C. word (圬) does mean a mason. I’ve translated the passage assuming that 巧 = 圬 here, given that it agrees with the parallel passage in SN 22.101.<br/>
Ordinarily, <em>palagaṇḍa</em> means a mason in both S. and P. The Theravāda commentary on the parallel passage claims that a carpenter is actually what is meant here, presumably to make sense of a mason using a woodworking tool. It’s possible that an ancient mason might have reason to cut wood in the course of his trade, so this re-interpretation may not be necessary; it’s just counterintuitive.
