<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 39 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 151 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0008c26" target="_blank">T99.2.8c26-9a26</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.54" target="_blank">SN 22.54</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>root seeds, stem seeds, joint seeds, seeds that fall naturally, and fruit seeds.</em> C. 根種子、莖種子、節種子、自落種子、實種子, P. <em>mūlabījaṁ, khandhabījaṁ, aggabījaṁ, phalubījaṁ, bījabījaññeva pañcamaṁ</em>. This list of seeds doesn’t seem to match the version in SN 22.54 entirely. The fourth item, which lit. means “self-falling seeds” would seem to match the last item in Pali, which refers to what we normally think of when we say “seeds.” The last item, 實種子, could mean “real seeds” or “fruit seeds.” The latter makes better sense to me. There isn’t a matching item in the C. list for P. <em>aggabīja</em>, which refers to plants that can grow from cuttings. Clearly, the term <em>bīja</em> is more allegorical, referring to anything from which something will grow, not just literal seeds. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>grow, increase, and develop.</em> C. 長增廣, P. <em>vuddhiṁ virūḷhiṁ vepullaṁ</em>. This is one of those cases when the C. would be misread without consulting the Indic parallel. The P. gives three verbs that match the C. well if we read the characters individually. Ordinarily, I would read 長增 as equiv. to 增長 (“to grow, enlarge”), and I have to wonder if the translator or editor didn’t purposely transpose 增長 knowing that it would be easily misread as a single term. 廣 typically means “wide, broad, extensive,” but it does often trans. S. <em>vaipulya</em> (P. <em>vepulla</em>). [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>four acquired substrates</em>. C. 四取攀緣. 攀緣 is parallel with P. <em>ārammaṇa</em> (S. <em>ārambaṇa</em>), which means a physical support like a handrail, or a mental support like a sense object. The C. term, however, suggests a verbal meaning “climbing on conditions” or “climbing on something,” evoking the image of vines climbing walls and fences, or someone using political connections to advance themselves. I take the intended meaning here to be like the English “substrate” as something in which things grow. The metaphor of water and earth as the substrates for plant growth indicates this meaning to me.<br/>
In SN 22.54, the water element is simply delight and attachment (<em>nandirāga</em>). Here, the object of those two things has been added for more specificity. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5"><em>something that’s impossible</em>. C. 非境界. This C. expression could translate terms like S. <em>agocara</em>, <em>aviṣaya</em>, which are both used to means something that is not real or impossible. Lit., they mean “not found anywhere.” [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>the mental stagnation in form that produced bondage is ended</em>. C. 於色封滯意生縛斷, P. <em>vocchijjatārammaṇaṁ patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa na hoti</em>. The C. translates a passage that was different than the P. parallel here. I suspect that 色封滯 translates <em>rūpupaya</em>, which means “attachment” or “getting involved with form.” In C., 封滯 lit. means “blocked, clogged, stagnant,” describing something like a clogged drain that causes a back up of stagnant water. Metaphorically, it means a lack of free flow or movement that leads to stagnation. This, I think, must have been intended as a metaphor for being stuck in or attached to form. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>the mental stagnation in volition that produced bondage</em>. C. 於行封滯意生觸. The Taisho reading here has “contact” (觸) rather than “bondage” (縛). I’ve followed Yinshun’s amendation in my translation that treats the 觸 reading as an error. The Taisho reading, though, creates an interesting distinction between form and the other three aggregates if we were to accept it as correct. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>four intercardinals</em>. C. 四維. 維 here trans. a word like S. <em>vidiśa</em>, referring to the directions between the four cardinals (northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest). Thus, the ten directions are being listed out here. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
