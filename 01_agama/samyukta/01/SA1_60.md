    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates. They are the acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of awareness. Monks, if ascetics or brahmins suppose there is a self, they would all suppose there is a self in relation to these five acquired aggregates. What are the five?</td>

Someone who doesn’t discard what belongs to self enters the faculties. Once they enter the faculties, then they produce contact. Entering what is contacted by those six contacts, a foolish and unlearned man produces pain and pleasure, and everything else arises from this. This is called the six kinds of contact. What are the six?</td>

Monks, there is an element of having a mind, an element of notions, and an element of ignorance, which are what come together as ignorant contact. The foolish and unlearned man speaks of existence, non-existence, existence and non-existence, neither existence nor non-existence, the supremacy of self, the resemblance of self, and knowing self and seeing self.</td>

    <td id='p6'>6. “Furthermore, monks, the learned and noble disciple lives in the six sense fields of contact, but he tires of ignorance and produces insight. He parts with desire for ignorance and produces insight, not existence, not non-existence, not existence and non-existence, not neither existence or non-existence, not the supremacy of self, not the resemblance of self, nor knowing self and seeing self. Once he knows and sees in this way, his ignorant contacts that arose previously will cease, and afterward insightful contact arises.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 63 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 60 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0016b13" target="_blank">T99.2.16b13-c3</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0002a12" target="_blank">Y30.2a12-3a3</a>). It’s a direct parallel of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.47" target="_blank">SN 22.47</a>.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two versions is the list of ideas that the ordinary man thinks about. In SN 22.47, they seem to be forward-looking and parallel various realms of rebirth, while here his ideas revolve around ontology and the nature of self. Another difference is that, while it has the concept of ignorant contact, SN 22.47 does not include insightful contact that arises when ignorant contact ceases. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
