Cf. the <cite><a href="https://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/ka/kappa.htm" target="_blank">Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</a></cite> for a summary of sources in which this character appears in Theravāda texts.[<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Kappa</em>. C. 劫波 (EMC <em>kɪʌp-pua</em> = G. <em>kapa</em> or <em>kappa</em>), P. <em>kappa</em>, S. <em>*kalpa</em>. The C. translit. appears to approximate an Indic <em>-pp-</em>, which would match a Pr. rather than S. pronunciation, but I haven’t located an attestation in S. sources for this character. Presumably, it would have been Sanskritized to <em>kalpa</em>.[<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
