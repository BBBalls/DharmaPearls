### 23 (17). Not Mine

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat. He adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder, and saluted the Buddha with his palms together. He said, “It would be good, Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly. [I’ll then think:] ‘A good son leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes, believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home to train on the path. That’s the way he reaches the ultimate and unsurpassed religious life. He’ll personally realize in the present life: “My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”
{:#p2}

3\. The Bhagavān told that monk, “Good, good! Did you say, ‘Bhagavān, give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. From that brief explanation of the Dharma, I will get a full understanding of its meaning. I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … <em>up to</em> … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence’”’? Is this what you said?”
{:#p3}

The monk said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān.”


4\. The Buddha addressed the monk, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Monk, you should quickly get rid of something that doesn’t belong to you. Someone who gets rid of that thing will be benefited by this doctrine, and they’ll find happiness for a long time.”
{:#p4}

That monk then said to the Buddha, “I’ve understood, Bhagavān! I’ve understood, Sugata!”


5\. The Buddha said to the monk, “How do you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full?”
{:#p5}

6\. The monk said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, form doesn’t belong to me, so I should get rid of it quickly. [Having gotten rid of it, I will be benefited by this doctrine, and I’ll find happiness for a long time.] Feeling … conception … volition … consciousness doesn’t belong to me, so I should get rid of it quickly. [Having gotten rid of it,] I will be benefited by this doctrine, and I’ll find happiness for a long time. Therefore, Bhagavān, I understand the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma in full.”
{:#p6}

7\. The Buddha said, “Good! It’s good, monk, that you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full. Why is that? Form doesn’t belong to you, so you should get rid of it quickly. [Having gotten rid of it, you will be benefited by this doctrine, and you’ll find happiness for a long time.] Thus, feeling … conception … volition … consciousness doesn’t belong to you, so you should get rid of it quickly. [Having gotten rid of it,] you will be benefited by this doctrine, and you’ll find happiness for a long time.”
{:#p7}

8\. When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he felt great joy. He bowed to the Buddha and withdrew. He then went alone to a quiet place where he diligently trained and lived earnestly. After diligently training and living earnestly, he thought, “A good son leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes, believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home … <em>up to</em> … ‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”
{:#p8}

9\. That monk then became an <em>arhat</em>, and his mind was liberated.
{:#p9}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} The closest parallel for this <em>sūtra</em> appears to be <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.34/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.34</a>, but it does not include the a backstory or a monk who comes to ask the Buddha for a Dharma teaching. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.33</a> uses the same template but includes a simile not found here. The next three <em>sūtra</em>s (<a href="SA1_24.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.24-26</a>) are variants that substitute different principles for the monk to contemplate. [\[back\]](#ref1)
