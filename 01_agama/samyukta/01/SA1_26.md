### 26 (20). What Affects

<em>A sūtra about being affected[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} was taught in the same way [as the <a href="SA1_25.html" target="_blank">previous sūtra</a>].</em>
{:#p1}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} The <cite>Taisho</cite> reads: “a profound <em>sūtra</em>” (深經). Both Yinshun and CBETA amend this to “a <em>sūtra</em> about being affected” (染經), assuming that 深 is a typo for 染. If that’s true (and I don’t see any better suggestion to make sense of it), then this would have been a variant of the previous three <em>sūtra</em>s that substituted “something affecting” as the thing to get rid of.
