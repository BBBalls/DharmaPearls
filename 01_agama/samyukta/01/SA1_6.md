### 6. Not Knowing

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When you don’t know or understand form and [1b] don’t stop or become free of desire for it, it’s not possible to stop suffering. Thus, when you don’t know or understand feeling … perception … volition … consciousness and don’t stop or become free of desire for it, it’s not possible to stop suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you know and understand form and stop and become free of desire for it, it’s possible to stop suffering. Thus, if you know and understand feeling … perception … volition … consciousness and stop and become free of desire for it, it’s possible to end suffering.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24){:target="_blank"} and SĀ 2.6. [\[back\]](#ref1)
