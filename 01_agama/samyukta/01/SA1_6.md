### 6. Not Knowing

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When you don’t know, understand, [1b] stop, and become free of desire for form, you can’t stop suffering. Thus, when you don’t know, understand, stop and become free of desire for feeling … perception … volition … consciousness, you can’t stop suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you know, understand, stop, and become free of desire for form, you can stop suffering. Thus, if you know, understand, stop, and become free of desire for feeling … perception … volition … consciousness, you can stop suffering.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24){:target="_blank"} and SĀ 2.6. [\[back\]](#ref1)
