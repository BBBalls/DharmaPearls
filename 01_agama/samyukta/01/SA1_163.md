### 163. What’s Destroyed

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will discuss things that are destroyed and not destroyed. Listen closely, and well consider it. I will explain this for you.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, form is something destroyed, but the cessation and extinguishment  of that form is not something that’s destroyed. Feeling … perception … volition … consciousness is something destroyed, but the cessation and extinguishment of that consciousness is not something that’s destroyed.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.32](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.32){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
