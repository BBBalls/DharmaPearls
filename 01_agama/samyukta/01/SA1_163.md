### 163 (51). What’s Destroyed

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will discuss things that are destroyed and not destroyed.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, form is something destroyed, but the cessation and extinguishment[\[3\]](#n3){:#ref3} of that form is not something that’s destroyed. Feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is something destroyed, but the cessation and extinguishment of that consciousness is not something that’s destroyed.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel with [SN 22.32](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.32){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}*destroyed*. C. 壞. The Pali parallel has *pabhaṅga*, which Pali commentators interpreted as “fragile” or “brittle,” but which can mean “destroyed.” 壞 often means simply “to be destroyed,” but it has the connotation of gradual destruction, so it often means something more like “eroded” or “ruined.” In both cases, there’s a sense of destruction over time (i.e., impermanence).
3. {:#n3}*extinguishment*. C. 涅槃. I believe here the Chinese is transliterating a verb related to nirvāṇa that’s here a participle meaning “extinguished.” The Pali parallel lacks this, giving two other synonyms for cessation: *nirodho vūpasamo atthaṅgamo*. [\[back\]](#ref3)
