They are the acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … and the acquired aggregate of awareness. It’s good that a monk isn’t pleased by form, doesn’t praise form, doesn’t take form, and isn’t attached to form. It’s good that a monk isn’t pleased by feeling … conception … volition … awareness, doesn’t praise awareness, doesn’t take awareness, and isn’t attached to awareness. Why is that?</td>

In this way, if a monk isn’t pleased by feeling … conception … volition … awareness, doesn’t praise awareness, doesn’t take awareness, isn’t attached to awareness, then his mind becomes liberated by not being pleased by awareness. If a monk isn’t pleased by form, his mind becomes liberated. In this way, if he isn’t pleased by feeling … conception … volition … awareness, his mind becomes liberated. Neither ceasing nor arising, he abides in equitable detachment with correct mindfulness and knowledge.</td>

Having seen them and their origin as forever ended without remainder, he also sees them and their endpoint as forever ended without remainder. Having seen them and their endpoint as forever ended without remainder, he also sees them and both their origin and endpoint as forever ended without remainder. He is attached to nothing. Someone who is attached to nothing takes nothing whatsoever from any world. Someone who takes nothing also seeks nothing. Someone who seeks nothing realizes <em>nirvāṇa</em> for themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I wont be subject to a later existence.’”</td>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 60 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 57 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0015b22" target="_blank">T99.2.15b22-c13</a>). While it is listed by some as having <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.5" target="_blank">SN 22.5</a> as a parallel, there is only a tangential resemblance. The P. <em>sutta</em> mentions a monk understanding the origin and end of the five aggregates through meditative insight, but here there is no explicit mention of <em>samādhi</em>. There are certainly a number of shared passages, but they have been assembled into somewhat different texts. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
