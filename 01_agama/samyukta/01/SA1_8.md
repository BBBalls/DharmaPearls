### 8. Not Knowing (3)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When you don’t know or understand form and don’t become free of desire for it, the mind isn’t liberated. When the mind isn’t liberated, it’s not possible to stop suffering. Thus, when you don’t know or understand feeling … perception … volition … consciousness and don’t become free of desire for it, the mind isn’t liberated, and it’s not possible to stop suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you know and understand form and become free of desire for it, the mind is liberated, and it’s possible to stop suffering. Thus, if you know and understand feeling … perception … volition … consciousness and become free of desire for it, your mind is liberated, and it’s possible to [1c] stop suffering.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This sūtra is similar to [SN 22.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24){:target="_blank"} and parallel with SĀ 2.8. The *Taisho* version of this sutra copies content from SĀ 1.10 into its beginning, making it a “double sūtra.” I’ve followed Yinshun’s lead in deleting this material as spurious on the grounds that the uddāna for this group of sūtras only mentions one sūtra on delight. We should also note that SĀ 2.8 would be a strong parallel if we delete the added material, which then maintains the pattern of SĀ 1.1-10 corresponding closely to SĀ 2.1-10. [\[back\]](#ref1)
