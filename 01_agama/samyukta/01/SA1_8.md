Their mind not being liberated, they can’t stop suffering. Thus, when one doesn’t know and understand feeling … conception … volition … awareness and doesn’t become free of desire for it, their mind isn’t liberated, and then they can’t stop suffering.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 5 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 8 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0001b16" target="_blank">T99.2.1b16-c1</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0007a05" target="_blank">Y30.7a5-10</a>). It’s a variant of the previous two and next <em>sūtra</em>. As a group, they are parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24" target="_blank">SN 22.24</a>, and this <em>sūtra</em> is parallel with <a href="../02/SA2_8.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.8</a>.</p>
<p>The <cite>Taisho</cite> version of this <em>sūtra</em> copies content from <a href="SA1_10.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.10 (7)</a> into its beginning. I’ve followed Yinshun’s lead in ignoring this material as spurious on two grounds. First, the <em>uddāna</em> verse for this group of <em>sūtra</em>s only mentions one <em>sūtra</em> on delight. Second, <a href="../02/SA2_8.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.8</a> would be a strong parallel if we deleted the added material. This would then maintain the pattern of SĀ 1.1-10 corresponding closely to SĀ 2.1-10. The most likely explanation is that a copyist lost their place and copied a few lines from the wrong <em>sūtra</em>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
