<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 64 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 61 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0016c04" target="_blank">T99.2.16c4-7a22</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0101a13" target="_blank">Y30.101a13-3a7</a>). It’s a direct parallel of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.55" target="_blank">SN 22.55</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Hall of Mṛgāra’s Mother</em>. C. <span class="ch">鹿子母講堂</span>, G. <em>*mugaramaduprasada</em>, P. <em>migāramātupāsāda</em>, S. <em>mṛgāramātuḥ prāsāda</em>. This was a meeting hall donated to the <em>saṅgha</em> by the laywoman Viśākhā (P. Visākhā). She was given the epithet “Mṛgāra’s Mother” because her husband Mṛgāra took to calling her “mother” after she introduced him to the Buddha’s teaching. Her husband’s name is derived from the root <em>mṛga</em>, which means “animal” or “deer.” This is the reason his name was translated to C. as “young deer” or “fawn” (<span class="ch">鹿子</span>). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Things … lower bonds.</em>. C. <span class="ch">『法無有吾我，亦復無我所。我既非當有，我所何由生？』比丘解脫此，則斷下分結。</span>, P. <em>‘no cassaṁ, no ca me siyā, nābhavissa, na me bhavissatī’ti—evaṁ adhimuccamāno bhikkhu chindeyya orambhāgiyāni saṁyojanānī</em>. The Chinese translation, while closely resembling the Pali parallel, has a couple significant differences. One is that the word <em>dharma</em> is the subject of the first line, which is left understood in SN 22.55. As we shall see below, it stands for the five aggregates that are treated as the things that could be considered a person’s self.</p>
<p>The second difference is less clear given how frequent textual errors and literalisms are in SĀ. The verb <span class="ch">解脫</span> means “liberated, freed,” but words like S. <em>adhimukta</em> (P. <em>adhimucca</em>) were also translated as <span class="ch">信解</span> (lit. “release of faith”) or <span class="ch">勝解</span> (lit. “greater release”). The Pali parallel has the term <em>adhimuccamāna</em>, which means “settling the mind on” or “inclining the mind toward.” This is often translated more idiomatically as “being confident in,” “resolved on,” or “inclined to.” However, we should not overlook the fact that P. <em>adhimuccati</em> does lit. mean “released toward,” being a figurative expression for freedom from doubt or indecision.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s difficult to tell which meaning I should settle my own mind on. In this case, <span class="ch">解脫</span> might well be an overly literal translation of S. <em>adhimukta</em> or <em>adhimokṣa</em>, but I’ve decided to preserve the literal reading here. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>This is actually a single question about the entire set of verses in the original text. I’ve broken it into three questions for the sake of conforming to the English expectation that a question be a single sentence. The same awkwardly long question is asked in SN 22.55 as well, which translators like Sujato truncate to make it fit the confines of English grammar. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>impermanent … painful … selfless … will not exist … destroyed</em>. C. <span class="ch">無常⋯苦⋯無我⋯非當有⋯壞有</span>, P. <em>aniccaṁ … dukkhaṁ … anattaṁ … saṅkhataṁ … vibhavissati</em>. There is a slight difference in this series of attributes compared to the Pali. In SN 22.55, “will not be” (<em>nābhavissa</em>) is replaced with “conditioned” (<em>saṅkhataṁ</em>) when compared to the C. here. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>Again, this is one long question about the entire description of an <em>arhat</em>’s liberation, which I have broken into smaller questions that consist of individual sentences. In SN 22.55, this question is simpler, asking only about how such a monk can end the contaminants in the present life. Equivalent descriptions of liberation have been added here, which make the question cumbersome. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p><em>substrates.</em> C. <span class="ch">攀緣</span>, G. ?, P. <em>upaya</em>, S. <em>upayat</em>. In <a href="SA1_151.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.151</a> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.54" target="_blank">SN 22.54</a>), the P. term parallel to <span class="ch">攀緣</span> is <em>ārammaṇa</em> rather than <em>upaya</em>. P. <em>ārammaṇa</em> (“basis, footing, foundation”) is much closer in meaning to <span class="ch">攀緣</span> (“climbing support”) than <em>upaya</em> (“approaching, involvement, attachment”). It seems the C. translates a word like P. <em>ārammaṇa</em> or S. <em>upayamana</em> (“support”), but it doesn’t fully agree with <em>upaya</em>. My own translation of the term as “substrate” is to capture the intended meaning of “support for growth” that we find in both texts. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p><em>uncertainty.</em> C. <span class="ch">癡</span>. Yinshun suggests that <span class="ch">癡</span> (“delusion”), which typically translates <em>moha</em>, should be amended to <span class="ch">疑</span> (“doubt, uncertainty”). This seems justified given the equivalent term is <span class="ch">疑惑</span> (“uncertain, perplexed”) in the same stock passage found in <a href="../02/SA2_97.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.97 (213)</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0072b20" target="_blank">SĀ 2.218 (273)</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0091a24" target="_blank">SĀ 2.246 (319)</a>, and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0110c13" target="_blank">SĀ 4.69 (418)</a>.</p>
<p>Two P. parallels (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.23" target="_blank">SN 35.23</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.92" target="_blank">92</a>) also include a version of this stock passage that reads: “They’d have no grounds for that, they’d be stumped by questions, and, in addition, they’d get frustrated. Why is that? Because they’re out of their element” (<em>tassa vācāvatthukamevassa; puṭṭho ca na sampāyeyya, uttariñca vighātaṁ āpajjeyya. Taṁ kissa hetu? Yathā taṁ, bhikkhave, avisayasmin</em>). There, the parallel word is P. <em>vighāta</em> (“vexation, annoyance, distress”).</p>
<p>I have translated it as Yinshun suggested. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p>SN 22.55 follows the same line of thought as we find here, but this passage is much more verbose by comparison. The conclusion that follows is also different than the one in SN 22.55, which simply states: “The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this” (<em>Evaṁ kho, bhikkhu, jānato evaṁ passato anantarā āsavānaṁ khayo hotī</em>). [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p>This is the only passage in SĀ that uses the ten directions to express the idea of “anywhere in the world.” The passage appears to reference the metaphor of an extinguished fire. When it goes out, it doesn’t go to another location. It disappears. Here, the disappearance of awareness is described by a series of expressions that’s also unique to this <em>sūtra</em>: <span class="ch">涅槃、滅盡、寂靜、清涼</span>. These words could be read as verbal adjectives. I’ve chosen to read them as nouns. As adjectives, they would mean: “<em>nirvāṇa</em>-ed, completely ceased, stilled, and cooled.” [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n11"><p>In a note to this <em>uddāna</em> verse, Yinshun took <span class="ch">貪著</span> to refer to SĀ 1.59 and <span class="ch">等觀察</span> to SĀ 1.60, whereas I’m reading <span class="ch">貪著等觀察</span> as a description of the contents of the present <em>sūtra</em>, SĀ 1.61. Yinshun was uncertain what the three kinds of discernment would be if <span class="ch">三種分別</span> referred only to SĀ 1.58. My reading is an attempt to resolve that problem by reading it as referring to SĀ 1.58-60. All three of those <em>sūtra</em>s address the topic of the five acquired aggregates and could be read as three different analyses of that subject. I have to admit, though, that it’s not entirely clear what was intended. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</p></li>
