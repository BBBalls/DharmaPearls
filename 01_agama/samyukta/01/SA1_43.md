<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 260 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 43 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0065c12" target="_blank">T99.2.65c12-66a4</a>). Here, there is a transition from teachings given by Śāriputra to those given by Ānanda. The closest parallel is found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.21" target="_blank">SN 22.21</a> in which Ānanda asks the Buddha to define cessation, rather than Śāriputra asking Ānanda. The main difference between this and the Pali <em>sutta</em> is that here two causes that create the aggregates are identified and repeated throughout: past actions and the wish for them in the past. This likely refers to the Sarvāstivāda interpretation of dependent arising of a person, which places the first two steps, ignorance and action, as past causes for one’s present existence. See, e.g., the discussion of this topic in the <cite>Mahāvibhāṣā</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T27n1545_p0116b28" target="_blank">T1545.27.116b28ff</a>).
