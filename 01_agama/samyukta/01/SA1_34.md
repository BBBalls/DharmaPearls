    <td id='p2'>2. There was then a certain monk who came to visit the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He then said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, as the Bhagavān says ‘attain <em>nirvāṇa</em> in the present life,’ how does a monk attain <em>nirvāṇa</em> in the present life?”</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. The Buddha told the monk, “Becoming disillusioned with form, becoming free of desire for it, and completely ceasing it, one doesn’t create the contaminants, and their mind is properly liberated. This is called a monk who attains <em>nirvāṇa</em> in the present life. <em>It’s the same with feeling, conception, volition, awareness</em> … becoming disillusioned with awareness, becoming free of desire for it, completely ceasing it, one doesn’t create the contaminants, and their mind is properly liberated. This is called a monk who attains <em>nirvāṇa</em> in the present life.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 28 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 34 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0005c29" target="_blank">T99.2.5c29-6a11</a>). It, the previous three, and the next <em>sūtra</em> are variants of <a href="SA1_29.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.29-30</a> that feature anonymous monks who bring questions to the Buddha, rather than Rāhula. All five <em>sūtra</em>s comprise a separate chapter with their own <em>uddāna</em> verse and correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.115" target="_blank">SN 22.115-116</a>. While they each feature a question about a different expression used by the Buddha, his explanations all refer back to the same principle of liberation from desire for the five aggregates.
