### 31 (25). Well Versed

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that a certain monk came to visit the Buddha. He bowed to the Buddha and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha, “As the Bhagavān says ‘well versed,’ how is one well versed?”
{:#p2}

3\. The Buddha said to that monk, “Good, good! Are you asking me now about the meaning of ‘well versed’?”
{:#p3}

The monk said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān.”


4\. The Buddha told the monk, “[Listen closely!] Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain it for you. Monk, you should know that if one learns about becoming disillusioned with form, becoming free of desire for it, completely ceasing it, and the principle of peace,[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} this is called being well versed. Thus, if one learns about becoming disillusioned with feeling … conception … volition … consciousness, becoming free of desire for it, completely ceasing it, and the principle of peace, this is called being well versed. Monk, this is what the Tathāgata says is being well versed.”
{:#p4}

5\. When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he celebrated and rejoiced. Then, he bowed and departed.
{:#p5}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This and the next four <em>sūtra</em>s are variants of <a href="SA1_29.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.29-30</a> that feature anonymous monks who bring questions to the Buddha, rather than Rāhula. All five <em>sūtra</em>s comprise a separate chapter with their own <em>uddāna</em> verse and correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.115/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.115-116</a>. While they each feature a question about a different expression used by the Buddha, his explanations all refer back to the same rubric of liberation from desire for the five aggregates. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} <em>learns about … principle of peace</em>. C. 聞. Lit. “hears about.” Education in ancient India was conducted orally prior to the widespread adoption of writing, and even then oral recitation and memorization continued as a basic way of learning for a long time. Thus, “hearing about” something could mean being learned in the subject, as it does here. The expression 多聞 (P. <em>bahussuta</em>, S. <em>bahuśruta</em>), which lit. means “heard much” but functions as “very learned,” signals this context for us.<br/>
The three steps of disillusionment with, becoming free of desire for, and complete cessation of the aggregates is the common definition (or process) of being liberated from them. A fourth item is added here, the “principle of peace” (寂靜法). It’s not entirely clear to me what this expression means exactly, as it only occurs here and in the next <em>sūtra</em> in SĀ without any further comment about it. In other C. translations, it sometimes meant the teaching of peace that leads to Nirvāṇa, which certainly fits the context here (cf. T721.17.283a8: 爾時，彼處彌勒世尊說寂靜法向涅槃城⋯). Different fourth items are added in the other <em>sūtra</em>s; these apparent additions aren’t found in SN 22.115-116. [\[back\]](#ref2)
