### 33 (27). Going from One Principle to the Next

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. There was then a certain monk who came to visit the Buddha. He bowed his head and withdrew to stand at one side. He then said to the Buddha, “As the Bhagavān says ‘going from one principle to the next,’ what is going from one principle to the next?”
{:#p2}

3\. The Buddha told the monk, “Good, good! Do you want now to know about going from one principle to the next?”
{:#p3}

The monk said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān.”


4\. The Buddha told the monk, “[Listen closely!] Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Monk, head for disillusionment with form, become free of desire for it, and completely cease it. This is called going from one principle to the next. Thus with feeling … conception … volition … consciousness, head for disillusionment with consciousness, become free of desire for it, and completely cease it. This is called going from one principle to the next.”
{:#p4}

5\. When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he celebrated and rejoiced. He then bowed and departed.
{:#p5}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This, the previous two, and the next two <em>sūtra</em>s are variants of <a href="SA1_29.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.29-30</a> that feature anonymous monks who bring questions to the Buddha, rather than Rāhula. All five <em>sūtra</em>s comprise a separate chapter with their own <em>uddāna</em> verse and correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.115" target="_blank">SN 22.115-116</a>. While they each feature a question about a different expression used by the Buddha, his explanations all refer back to the same rubric of liberation from desire for the five aggregates. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} <em>going from one principle to the next</em>. C. 法次法向, P. <em>dhammānudhammappaṭipatti</em>. Lit. “proceeding from [one] <em>dharma</em> to the next <em>dharma</em>.” The C. translation of this term coupled with the explanation given by the Buddha suggests that it was interpreted to mean progressing through the gradual path to liberation in steps or stages. Here, the process of liberation from desire is used as the example for this, and this forces <em>dharma</em> to be read as a “state” or “principle.” I’ve opted for “principle,” along the lines of <em>dharma</em>’s common meaning of “rule” or “law.” [\[back\]](#ref2)
