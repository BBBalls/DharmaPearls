    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will now explain the aggregates and the acquired aggregates. What are the aggregates? Whatever forms there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all generally referred to as the form aggregate. Whatever feelings, conceptions, volitions, and instances of awareness there are are likewise. They are all generally referred to as the feeling, conception, volition, and awareness aggregate. They are called the aggregates.</td>

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 55 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 167 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0013b13" target="_blank">T99.2.13b13-23</a>). This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.48" target="_blank">SN 22.48</a>. This version is a bit expanded compared to SN 22.48 in the definition of the acquired aggregates. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>higher mental defilements</em>. C. 上煩惱心. Given that these defilements are manifold (種種), I suspect this may have been a translation of S. <em>upakleśa</em> (P. <em>upakilesa</em>), which were usually considered secondary or derivative defilements that combined elements of more basic defilements. Late Abhidharma traditions maintained lists of such defilements, and a couple of these lists are preserved in <em>sūtra</em>s. I’m not entirely certain if that was the original term, however, so I have left the C. translated literally. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
