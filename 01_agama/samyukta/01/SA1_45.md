    <td id='p18'>18. “‘Kātyāyana, the Tathāgata has abandoned these two extreme positions and teaches the middle way. That is, “That exists because this exists. That arises because this arose.” This refers to there being action because of ignorance … and then birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and suffering form.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 262 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 45 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0066b06" target="_blank">T99.2.66b6-67a21</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90" target="_blank">SN 22.90</a>. It picks up where the <cite>Parinirvāṇa Sūtra</cite> left off regarding the story of Chandaka, who had served as the Buddha’s servant before he left home. As a monk, he couldn’t overcome his arrogance and was verbally abusive. When asked how to deal with his bad behavior, the Buddha advised the Saṅgha to avoid speaking to him if it continued. Here, we have a story of Chandaka making amends with the Saṅgha after the Buddha had passed away. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>senior monks.</em>. C. 上座比丘, P. <em>therā bhikkhū</em>. C. 上座 (lit. “high seat”) likely translated the equiv. of P. <em>thera</em>. It refers to an elder monk who serves as the head of a <em>saṅgha</em> or monastery. Such a monastic would get the “high” or “head” seat when the assembly is seated together. I’ve translated the term functionally as “senior.”<br/>
<em>Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.</em> C. ⋯波羅㮈國、仙人住處、鹿野苑, P. <em>bārāṇasiyaṁ viharanti isipatane migadāye</em>. An equiv. of S. Bārāṇasī is here translit. as EMC. pua-la-na = G. Barana[si] (the final syllable being dropped). The other two place names are translated.<br/>
<em>Residence of Sages.</em> 仙人住處 lit. means “sage’s residence” or “hermitage,” which presumably translates G. *Iṣipadana (P. Isipatana, S. Ṛṣipatana). This translation, which was the consensus during the pre-Tang era in China, does not match the accepted understanding of the place name in Pali and some Sanskrit sources.<br/>
Later Chinese translators and commentators were aware of this situation. Yijing, Xuanzang, and other Tang-era translators working with Sanskrit texts translated it as we would expect: “Falling Place of Sages” (仙人墮處). The Korean Yogācāra commentator Doryun (釋道倫, u.d.) explained (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T42n1828_p0777a08" target="_blank">T1828.42.777a8-10</a>): “The old name ‘Residence of Sages’ is wrong. Once, there was a king who led his maidens on a tour of the park. Five hundred sages were in the sky who were about to be liberated, and they fell down upon seeing them. Therefore, the place was called ‘Falling Place of Sages.’” (There’s likely wordplay here since breaking one’s celebacy was considered a “downfall,” but the story here represents this literally as falling from the sky while flying or hovering.)<br/>
This was not always the case, however. In Xuanzang’s translation of the <cite>Mahāvibhāṣā</cite>, we find this passage (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T27n1545_p0917a20" target="_blank">T1545.27.917a20-29</a>): “Question: Why was it called the Lecture Place of Sages (仙人論處)? Answer: Some say that <em>buddha</em>s are certain to turn the Dharma wheel at this location. They explain that the Buddha was the supreme sage who first turned the Dharma wheel there. Therefore, it was named ‘The Lecture Place of Sages.’ There are those who say that <em>buddha</em>s are not certain to turn the Dharma wheel in this location. They explain that it should be called ‘The Residence of Sages’ (仙人住處). That is, when <em>buddha</em>s appear in the world, those <em>buddha</em>s are the great sages and their noble disciples are the assembly of sages that reside there. When <em>buddha</em>s don’t appear in the world, there are solitary awakened ones who reside there. When there aren’t any solitary awakened ones, there are worldly sages with the five powers who reside there. It’s named ‘The Residence of Sages’ because there has always been, are, and will be sages who reside there. Some say it should be named ‘The Falling Place of Sages’ (仙人墮處). There was a time when five hundred sages were flying in the sky and something happened that caused them to fall down there at the same time.”<br/>
This indicates that Buddhists interpreted this place name in at least three different ways. This might have been the result of variable pronunciations that resulted in differing meanings, or it may have simply been unclear from the start. For whatever reason, ‘Residence of Sages’ was the preferred reading during the pre-Sanskrit period in China when the Āgamas were translated, which gave way in later eras to the ‘Falling Place of Sages’ reading that is also seen in Theravāda sources.<br/>
<em>the Deer Preserve.</em> C. 鹿野苑, P. <em>migadāya</em>, S. <em>mṛgadāya</em>. Lit. “Deer Wilderness Preserve.”[<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>door key</em>. C. 戶鈎, P. <em>avāpuraṇa</em>. The C. lit. means “door hook,” P. interprets <em>avāpuraṇa</em> as a key to a door, and S. <em>avāpuraṇa</em> means a “filling or covering.” Given this confusing situation, I’ve translated the term in the way that makes the most sense given the context, which happens to agree with the Pali reading. The object in question may have been part of a simpler locking mechanism than a lock and key. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>domains</em>. C. 諸境界. It’s not clear what is meant here. Lit., 境界 means a geographical region or domain. In SĀ, it appears to translate P. <em>ṭhāna</em> (S. <em>sthāna</em>) and <em>visaya</em> (S. <em>viśaya</em>). In this particular passage, there is no Pali term that corresponds to it in SN 22.90. I take it to mean one’s immediately experienced environment, but it could mean philosophical positions, which would perhaps refer to a person’s world view. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5"><em>doesn’t exist … exists</em>. This passage is revealing in that we can infer something about the notions of “existing” and “not existing” in Buddhist discourse. We can see that the concept of something existing implied permanence, either of the thing itself or something intrinsic to it. This can be seen in the argument that the aggregates cannot be self because they are impermanent. On the other hand, non-existence doesn’t necessarily mean something is absent. We see this point here with the observation that the world doesn’t exist because it ceases. The subtext is that a <em>permanent</em> world doesn’t exist because it ceases.<br/>
It would seem that Buddhists were often contending with people who thought of existence and non-existence in absolute or ontological terms. Buddhists themselves had a naturalist view of existence as a temporary and effervescent condition. They could observe animal and plant species that do not disappear from the world, but the individuals of each species are continuously being born and dying, like bubbles forming and bursting. It would make sense that they extended this concrete observation to a general principle of the world itself. We see this expressed in the Buddhist myths of the world’s cycle of formation and destruction, which are being referenced in this passage. See, e.g., the stories of the world’s destruction and formation found in <a href="../../dirgha/DA_30-9.html" target="_blank">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="../../dirgha/DA_30-12.html" target="_blank">12</a> of <a href="../../dirgha/index.html" target="_blank">DĀ 30</a>.
