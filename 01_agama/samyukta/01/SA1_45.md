### 45 (262). Chandaka

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, there was a group of senior monks who were staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} It was not long after the Buddha’s <em>parinirvāṇa</em>.
{:#p1}

2\. At the time, the elderly Chandaka put on his robe and took his bowl to Bārāṇasī to solicit alms early in the morning. After eating, he returned and put away his robe and bowl. After he washed his feet, he took the door key[\[3\]](#n3){:#ref3} and went from grove to grove and from hut to hut, walking at length from place to place. Everywhere, he requested of the monks, “You should instruct me and teach the Dharma to me so that I will know and see the Dharma. I will follow that Dharma knowledge and observation.”
{:#p2}

3\. The monks then told Chandaka, “Form is impermanent. Feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is imperament. All actions are impermanent. All things are selfless. Nirvāṇa is peaceful cessation.”
{:#p3}

4\. Candaka said to the monks, “I already know that form is impermanent, that feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is imperament, that all actions are impermanent, that all things are selfless, and that Nirvāṇa is peaceful cessation.”
{:#p4}

5\. Chandaka also said, “Still, I don’t delight in hearing, ‘All actions being empty, at peace, and unobtainable, craving ends, one becomes free of desire and <em>nirvāṇa</em>-s.’ Isn’t there a self who says, ‘Knowing and seeing in this way is called seeing the Dharma.’ For a second and third time, he spoke in this way.”
{:#p5}

6\. Chandaka again said, “Who has the ability and capability to teach me the Dharma, to make me know and see the Dharma?” Then, he thought, “Venerable Ānanda is staying at Ghoṣila Park of Kauśāmbī. He had supported and was close to the Bhagavān, he was praised by the Buddha, and those of the religious life all know him. Surely, he can teach me the Dharma and make me know and see the Dharma.”
{:#p6}

7\. After the night had passed, Chandaka put on his robe and took his bowl to Bārāṇasī to solicit alms early in the morning. After eating, he returned and made his bed. After making his bed, he took his robe and bowl and traveled to Kauśāmbī, eventually making his way there on foot. He then put away his robe and bowl. After washing his feet, he went to Venerable Ānanda. After they had exchanged greetings, he withdrew to sit at one side.
{:#p7}

8\. Chandaka said to Venerable Ānanda, “One time, the senior monks were staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī. I then put on my robe and took my bowl to Bārāṇasī to solicit alms early in the morning. After eating, I returned and put away my robe and bowl. After I washed my feet, I took the door key and went from grove to grove and from hut to hut, walking at length from place to place. Everywhere, I requested of the monks, ‘You should instruct me and teach the Dharma to me so that I will know and see the Dharma. I will follow that Dharma knowledge and observation.’
{:#p8}

9\. “The monks then taught me the Dharma, ‘Form is impermanent. Feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is imperament. All actions are impermanent. All things are selfless. Nirvāṇa is peaceful cessation.’
{:#p9}

10\. “Then I said to the monks, ‘I already know that form is impermanent, that feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is imperament, that all actions are impermanent, that all things are selfless, and that Nirvāṇa is peaceful cessation. Still, I don’t delight in hearing, ‘All actions being empty, at peace, and unobtainable, craving ends, one becomes free of desire, and <em>nirvāṇa</em>-s.’ Isn’t there a self who says about this, ‘Knowing and seeing in this way is called seeing the Dharma.”’
{:#p10}

11\. “Then I thought, ‘Who is there who has the ability and capability to teach me the Dharma and make me know and see the Dharma?’ Again, I thought, ‘Venerable Ānanda is staying at Ghoṣila Park of Kauśāmbī. He had supported and was close to the Bhagavān, he was praised by the Buddha, and those of the religious life all know him. Surely, he can teach me the Dharma and make me know and see the Dharma.’
{:#p11}

12\. “It would be good if the Venerable Ānanda would teach me the Dharma now and make me know and see the Dharma.”
{:#p12}

13\. Venerable Ānanda then said to Chandaka, “Good, Chandaka! I would be happy to do that. Congratulations, sir, for being able to come before someone of the religious life without hiding anything and destroying the thorn of pretense. Chandaka, foolish, ordinary people aren’t able to understand that form is impermanent … that feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is impermanent. All actions are impermanent. All things are selfless. Nirvāṇa is peaceful cessation.”
{:#p13}

14\. Chandaka then thought, “Now, I’m feeling joyous! I’ve reached a more sublime and celebratory feeling. Now, I’m capable of receiving a more sublime Dharma.”
{:#p14}

15\. Ānanda then said to Chandaka, “I personally heard the Buddha say this when he was teaching Mahākātyāyana: ‘Worldly people are deluded by their reliance on two extreme positions, either existence or non-existence. Worldly people grasp at their domains,[\[4\]](#n4){:#ref4} and then their minds become attached to what they imagine.
{:#p15}

16\. “‘Kātyāyana, if one doesn’t accept, grasp, abide, or imagine the self, then when pain arises here, it arises, and it ceases when it ceases. Kātyāyana, they won’t be doubtful or confused. They’ll know for themselves instead of getting it from someone else. This is called right view as explained by the Tathāgata. Why is that?
{:#p16}

17\. “‘Kātyāyana, someone who truely and correctly contemplates the formation of the world won’t give rise to the view that the world doesn’t exist. Truly and correctly contemplating the cessation of the world, they won’t give rise to the view that the world exists.
{:#p17}

18\. “‘Kātyāyana, the Tathāgata has abandoned these two extreme positions and teaches the middle way. That is, “That exists because this exists. That arises because this arose.” This refers to there being volition because of ignorance … and then birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and suffering form. That is, “That doesn’t exist because this doesn’t exist. That ceases because this ceased.” This refers to volition ceasing when ignorance ceases … and then birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain cease.’”
{:#p18}

19\. When Venerable Ānanda taught this Dharma, the monk Chandaka became free of dust and defilement, and his Dharma eye was purified. The monk Chandaka then saw the Dharma, knew the Dharma, produced the Dharma, and went beyond any uncertainty. He became confident about the Dharma taught by the great teacher without relying on others.
{:#p19}

20\. He then saluted Venerable Ānanda with his palms together and said, “Precisely as it should be! Thus does a wise and good friend in the religious life teach, confer, and instruct another in the Dharma. Now, I’ve heard the Dharma in this way from Venerable Ānanda. All actions are empty. They are all peaceful and unobtainable. Craving has ended, and I’ve become free of desire. With complete cessation and Nirvāṇa, the mind is happy, properly abides, and is liberated. It doesn’t revert back again and doesn’t have views of self anymore. One only sees the correct Dharma.”
{:#p20}

21\. Ānanda said to Chandaka, “Now, you’ve gained a great and good benefit, having obtained the noble wisdom eye of the profound Buddha Dharma.”
{:#p21}

22\. Those two proper gentlemen [each heard that teaching and] were in turn delighted by it. They rose from their seats, and each returned to his home.
{:#p22}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.90</a>. It picks up where the <cite>Parinirvāṇa Sūtra</cite> left off regarding the story of Chandaka, who had served as the Buddha’s servant before he left home. As a monk, he couldn’t overcome his arrogance and was verbally abusive. When asked how to deal with his bad behavior, the Buddha advised the Saṅgha to avoid speaking to him if it continued. Here, we have a story of Chandaka making amends with the Saṅgha after the Buddha had passed away. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} <em>senior monks.</em>. C. 上座比丘, P. <em>therā bhikkhū</em>. C. 上座 (lit. “high seat”) likely translated the equiv. of P. <em>thera</em>. It refers to an elder monk who serves as the head of a <em>saṅgha</em> or monastery. Such a monastic would get the “high” or “head” seat when the assembly is seated together. I’ve translated the term functionally as “senior.”<br/>
<em>Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.</em> C. ⋯波羅㮈國、仙人住處、鹿野苑, P. <em>bārāṇasiyaṁ viharanti isipatane migadāye</em>. An equiv. of S. Bārāṇasī is here translit. as EMC. pua-la-na = G. Barana[si] (the final syllable being dropped). The other two place names are translated.<br/>
<em>Residence of Sages.</em> 仙人住處 lit. means “sage’s residence” or “hermitage,” which presumably translates G. *Iṣipadana (P. Isipatana, S. Ṛṣipatana). This translation, which was the consensus during the pre-Tang era in China, does not match the accepted understanding of the place name in Pali and some Sanskrit sources.<br/>
Later Chinese translators and commentators were aware of this situation. Yijing, Xuanzang, and other Tang-era translators working with Sanskrit texts translated it as we would expect: “Falling Place of Sages” (仙人墮處). The Korean Yogācāra commentator Doryun (釋道倫, u.d.) explained (cf. T1828.42.777a8-10): “The old name ‘Residence of Sages’ is wrong. Once, there was a king who led his maidens on a tour of the park. Five hundred sages were in the sky who were about to be liberated, and they fell down upon seeing them. Therefore, the place was called ‘Falling Place of Sages.’”<br/>
This was not always the case, however. In Xuanzang’s translation of the <cite>Mahāvibhāṣā</cite>, we find this passage (T1545.27.917a20-29): “Question: Why was it called the Lecture Place of Sages (仙人論處)? Answer: Some say that <em>buddha</em>s are certain to turn the Dharma wheel at this location. They explain that the Buddha was the supreme sage who first turned the Dharma wheel in this location. Therefore, it was named ‘The Lecture Place of Sages.’ There are those who say that <em>buddha</em>s are not certain to turn the Dharma wheel in this location. They explain that it should be called ‘The Residence of Sages’ (仙人住處). That is, when <em>buddha</em>s appear in the world, those <em>buddha</em>s are the great sages and their noble disciples are the assembly of sages that reside there. When <em>buddha</em>s don’t appear in the world, there are solitary awakened ones who reside there. When there aren’t any solitary awakened ones, there are worldly sages with the five powers who reside there. It’s named ‘The Residence of Sages’ because there has always been, are, and will be sages who reside there. Some say it should be named ‘The Falling Place of Sages’ (仙人墮處). There was a time when five hundred sages were flying in the sky and something happened that caused them to fall down there at the same time.”<br/>
This indicates that Buddhists interpreted this place name in at least three different ways. This might have been the result of variable pronunciations that resulted in differing meanings, or it may have simply been unclear from the start. For whatever reason, ‘Residence of Sages’ was the preferred reading during the pre-Sanskrit period in China when the Āgamas were translated, which gave way in later eras to the ‘Falling Place of Sages’ reading.<br/>
<em>the Deer Preserve.</em> C. 鹿野苑, P. <em>migadāya</em>, S. <em>mṛgadāya</em>. Lit. “Deer Wilderness Preserve.” [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3} <em>door key</em>. C. 戶鈎, P. <em>avāpuraṇa</em>. The C. lit. means “door hook,” P. interprets <em>avāpuraṇa</em> as a key to a door, and S. <em>avāpuraṇa</em> means a “filling or covering.” Given this confusing situation, I’ve translated the term in the way that makes the most sense given the context, which happens to agree with the Pali reading. The object in question may have been a simpler locking mechanism than the key to a lock. [\[back\]](#ref3)
4. {:#n4} <em>domains</em>. C. 諸境界. It’s not clear what is meant here. Lit., 境界 means a geographical region or domain. In SĀ, it appears to translate P. <em>ṭhāna</em> (S. <em>sthāna</em>) and <em>visaya</em> (S. <em>viśaya</em>). In this particular passage, there is no Pali term that corresponds to it in SN 22.90. I take it to mean one’s immediately experienced environment, but it could mean philosophical positions, which would perhaps refer to a person’s world view. [\[back\]](#ref4)
