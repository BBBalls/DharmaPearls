### 29 (23). Rāhula’s Question

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that Venerable Rāhula visited the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to sit at one side, and said, “Bhagavān, how do I know and how do I see this body of consciousness and all the signs of the external world such that I’ll have no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self pride?”
{:#p2}

3\. The Bhagavān then said to Rāhula, “Good! It’s good that you can ask the Tathāgata, ‘How do I know and how do I see this body of consciousness and all the signs of the external world such that I’ll have no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self pride?’! [Is that what you asked?]”
{:#p3}

Rāhula said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān.”


4\. The Buddha told Rāhula, “Good! Listen closely! listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Rāhula, you should observe that whatever forms there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all not self, not different than self, and neither are present in the other. They are correctly observed with equitable wisdom in this way.
{:#p4}

5\. “Thus, whatever feelings … conceptions … volitions … consciousnesses there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all not self, not different than self, and neither are present in the other. They are correctly observed with equitable wisdom in this way.
{:#p5}

6\. “Thus, Rāhula, a monk who knows and sees this body of consciousness and all the signs of the external world in this way will have no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self pride.
{:#p6}

7\. “Rāhula, if a monk has no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self pride regarding this body of consciousness and all the signs of the external world, that monk is called one who has stopped craving desires and turned away from the bonds. Right at that moment,[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} he reaches the final end of suffering.”
{:#p7}

8\. When Rāhula heard what the Buddha taught, he rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.91/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.91-92</a>. It also shares a very similar template with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn18.21/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 18.21-22</a> and <a href="../02/SA2_41-48.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.41-48</a>  (which apply the same template to the six senses and related elements of sensory experience).<br/>
A comparison of this <em>sūtra</em> with SĀ 2.41-48 is instructive in the instability of Chinese translations of nearly identical Indic <em>sūtra</em>s. Seemingly minor changes in wording and grammar make the meaning of these parallel texts shift in significant ways. It’s difficult to determine whether this was the result of inconsistent translation or poor copying of the text in later centuries. The same issues may have existed in the original manuscript that was translated to Chinese, too. Being that it’s difficult to decide with certainty which version is the most accurate, I’ve translated both Chinese translations as faithfully as possible. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} <em>right at that moment</em>. C. 正無間等. Lit. “exactly immediate.” There are passages in SĀ that appear to indicate that P. <em>abhisamaya</em> is the parallel to 無間等, but the two words mean very different things, making it unlikely to me. S. <em>ānantarya</em> (“immediate succession”) would match the meaning of the C. much better. If that’s the case, then the Indic parallel would have been equiv. to something like S. <em>samānantarya</em> (“a complete immediacy”?). The functional meaning of the word here would seem to describe the immediacy of a sudden realization. This might explain why the corresponding word in some P. parallels is <em>abhisamaya</em> (“penetration to understanding”). [\[back\]](#ref2)
