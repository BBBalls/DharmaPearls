Because he does not truly know form’s formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape, a foolish and unlearned ordinary man takes delight in form, praises, grasps, and attaches to it, and grasps it as a self or what belongs to self. If that form changes or becomes different after he grasps it, his mind changes and becomes different along with it. He then accepts this mental abode because his mind changes and becomes different along with it. Then, fear, obstructions, and expectations arise because he accepts that mental abode, which is because he was born and bound. <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise.</em> This is called being born and bound.</td>

Truly knowing it, he doesn’t take delight in form or praise, grasp, or become attached to it. Nor is he bound by self or what belongs to self and grasp them. If that form changes or becomes different, his mind doesn’t change or become different along with it because he doesn’t grasp it. His mind doesn’t become bound or accept a mental abode because his mind doesn’t change and become different along with it.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 44 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 156 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0011a13" target="_blank">T99.2.11a13-29</a>). Like the previous <em>sūtra</em>, it has a clear similarity with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.7" target="_blank">SN 22.7</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.8" target="_blank">8</a>, but fear is tangential to the subject of the lecture. Rather, the Buddha teaches how birth leads to being bound. SN 22.7 is a closer match to this and the previous <em>sūtra</em> than SN 22.8. All four appear to be variants of some older original. The theme of being born in bondage is found in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.117" target="_blank">SN 22.117</a>, but these two <em>sūtra</em>s bear little resemblance to each other beyond this.
