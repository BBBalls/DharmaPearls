### 27 (21). Shaken

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat, [adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder,] bowed to the Buddha, [and withdrew to stand at one side]. He then said to the Buddha, “[It would be good,] Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly. Having lived earnestly, I’ll then think, “A good son leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes, believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home … <em>up to</em> … ‘“I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”
{:#p2}

3\. The Bhagavān then told that monk, “Good, good! Did you say, ‘It would be good, Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … <em>up to</em> … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence’”’? [Is this what you said?]”
{:#p3}

The monk said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān.”


4\. The Buddha addressed the monk, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Monk, if one is shaken,[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} they are tied up by Māra. If one isn’t shaken, then they are free of Māra.”
{:#p4}

That monk then said to the Buddha, “I’ve understood, Bhagavān! I’ve understood, Sugata!”


5\. The Buddha said to the monk, “How do you understand my brief explanation of the Dharma in full?”
{:#p5}

6\. The monk said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, if form shakes [a person], then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Thus, if feeling … conception … volition … consciousness shakes them, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Therefore, I understand the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma in full.”
{:#p6}

7\. The Buddha said, “Good! It’s good, monk, that you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full. Why is that? If form shakes a person, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Thus, if feeling … conception … volition … consciousness shakes them, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra.”
{:#p7}

8\. … <em>Up to</em> … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence’” … His mind was liberated, and he became an <em>arhat</em>.”
{:#p8}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This <em>sūtra</em> is a variant of <a href="SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a>, and it has a parallel in Pali at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.34/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.34</a>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.33</a> uses the same template but includes a simile not found here. The previous four <em>sūtra</em>s (SĀ 1.23-26) substituted different principles for the monk to contemplate but otherwise employ the same template. See <a href="../01/SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a> for the full passages that were abbreviated here. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} <em>shaken</em>. C. 動搖. Like the English word “shaken,” 動搖 lit. means to “move, tremble, waver.” However, it’s very often used to refer to a person being disturbed, hesitant, or uncertain.   It can also mean to lose faith or confidence like “waver” often does in English. It’s not entirely clear to me which meaning is intended here, though I would assume that it’s psychological rather than literal. [\[back\]](#ref2)
