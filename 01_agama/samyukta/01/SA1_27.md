    <td id='p2'>2. There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat, [adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder,] bowed to the Buddha, [and withdrew to stand at one side]. He then said to the Buddha, “[It would be good,] Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly. Having lived earnestly, I’ll then think, “A good son [leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes,] believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home … <em>up to</em> …‘“I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 21 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 27 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0004b26" target="_blank">T99.2.4b26-c19</a>). It’s a variant of <a href="SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a>, and it has a parallel in Pali at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.34" target="_blank">SN 22.34</a>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33" target="_blank">SN 22.33</a> follows the same template but includes a simile not found here. The previous four <em>sūtra</em>s (SĀ 1.23-26) substituted different principles for the monk to contemplate but otherwise employed the same template. See <a href="../01/SA1_23.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.23</a> for the full passages that were abbreviated here. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>shaken</em>. C. 動搖. Like the English word “shaken,” 動搖 lit. means to “move, tremble, waver.” However, it’s very often used to refer to a person being disturbed, hesitant, or uncertain.   It can also mean to lose faith or confidence like “waver” often does in English. It’s not entirely clear to me which meaning is intended here, though I would assume that it’s psychological rather than literal. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
