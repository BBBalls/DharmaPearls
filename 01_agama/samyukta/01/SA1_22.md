### 22. Proliferation

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that a certain monk came to the Buddha … *and asked the same question as in [SĀ 1.21](SA1_21.html).*
{:#p2}

…

*The Buddha’s teaching was different*: “When someone follows the tendencies and follows death, then then increase in number. When someone doesn’t follow the tendencies and doesn’t follow death, then they don’t increase in number.”

…

3\. The Buddha told the monk, “How do you understand in detail the meaning of my brief explanation of the teaching?”
{:#p3}

4\. That monk then said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, suppose form follows the tendencies and follows death. When it follows the tendencies and follows death, it increases in number. Thus, suppose feeling … conception … volition … consciousness follows the tendencies and follows death. When it follows the tendencies and follows death, it increases in number.
{:#p4}

5\. “Bhagavān, suppose form doesn’t follow the tendencies and doesn’t follow death. When it doesn’t follow the tendencies and doesn’t follow death, it doesn’t increase in number. Thus, suppose feeling … conception … volition … consciousness doesn’t follow the tendencies and doesn’t follow death. When it doesn’t follow the tendencies and doesn’t follow death, it doesn’t increase in number. Thus, Bhagavān, is my understanding in detail of this brief explanation of the teaching.”
{:#p5}

…

6\. When that monk became an arhat, his mind was liberated.
