<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 259 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 42 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0065b05" target="_blank">T99.2.65b5-c11</a>). It’s similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.122" target="_blank">SN 22.122-123</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ea34.1" target="_blank">EĀ 34.1</a>. The version in EĀ matches the Pali parallel in that “direct realization” isn’t mentioned. Instead, the initial question is about an “ethical” monk. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
