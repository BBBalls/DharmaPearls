### 42 (259). Direct Realization

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha. At the time, the Venerable Śāriputra and Mahākauṣṭhila were on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa.
{:#p1}

2\. Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila rose from meditation in the afternoon and visited Śāriputra. Once they had exchanged greetings and joked in various ways, he withdrew to sit to one side.
{:#p2}

3\. Mahākauṣṭhila then said to Śāriputra, “I have a question I’d like to ask if you might have some time to explain it for me?”
{:#p3}

Śāriputra said, “Sir, you may ask your question. I will answer with that I know.”


4\. Mahākauṣṭhila then asked Śāriputra, “If a monk who has yet to directly realize the Dharma wishes to pursue that direct realization, what method does he use to do that? What teaching does he contemplate?”
{:#p4}

5\. Śāriputra replied, “A monk who has yet to directly realize the Dharma and wants to pursue that realization diligently contemplates this: ‘The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates the five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of stream entry.”
{:#p5}

6\. Mahākauṣṭhila also asked, “Śāriputra, suppose he wants to realize the fruit of once-returning after realizing the fruit of stream entry. What teaching will he contemplate?”
{:#p6}

7\. Śāriputra replied, “Kauṣṭhila, [a monk] who wants to realize the fruit of once-returning after realizing the fruit of stream entry should also diligently contemplate this: ‘The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of once-returning.”
{:#p7}

8\. Mahākauṣṭhila asked Śāriputra, “Suppose he wants to realize the fruit of non-returning after realizing the fruit of once-returning. What teaching will he contemplate?”
{:#p8}

9\. Śāriputra replied, “Kauṣṭhila, [a monk] who wants to realize the fruit of non-returning after realizing the fruit of once-returning will also diligently contemplate this: ‘The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of non-returning.”
{:#p9}

10\. Mahākauṣṭhila asked Śāriputra, “Suppose he wants to realize the fruit of the <em>arhat</em> after realizing the fruit of non-returning. What teaching will he contemplate?”
{:#p10}

11\. Śāriputra replied, “Kauṣṭhila, [a monk] who wants to realize the fruit of the <em>arhat</em> after realizing the fruit of non-returning should also diligently contemplate this: ‘The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because it’s appropriate for his situation. If a monk diligently contemplates these five acquired aggregates, he’ll realize the fruit of the <em>arhat</em>.”
{:#p11}

12\. Mahākauṣṭhila asked Śāriputra, “What teaching does he contemplate after attaining the fruit of the <em>arhat</em>?”
{:#p12}

13\. Śāriputra replied, “Mahākauṣṭhila, an <em>arhat</em> also contemplates this: ‘The five acquired aggregates are like illnesses, abscesses, thorns, and killers. They are impermanent, painful, empty, and not self.’ Why is that? Because he has attained what he had yet to attain, realized what he had yet to realize, and he lives happily in this life.”
{:#p13}

14\. When those two upright men each heard what was taught, they rejoiced and departed.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This <em>sūtra</em> is similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.122/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 22.122-123</a> and EĀ 34.1. The version in EĀ matches the Pali parallel in that “direct realization” isn’t mentioned. Instead, the initial question is about an “ethical” monk. [\[back\]](#ref1)
