    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Form is not self. If form were self, it wouldn’t be that illness and pain arise from form, and there wouldn’t be these desires about form: ‘Let it be so; let it not be so.’ Because form has no self, illness and pain arise from it, and these desires become possible: ‘Let it be so; let it not be so.’ <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise.</em></td>

    <td id='p5'>5. “If it’s impermanent and painful, it’s liable to change. Given that, would a well-versed noble disciple see form as having self, as being other than self, or that either form or self is present in the other?”</td>

    <td id='p7'>7. “Monks, a well-versed noble disciple truly observes that what’s in these five acquired aggregates is not self and doesn’t belong to self. Having truly observed this, they take hold of nothing from all the world. Because they take hold of nothing, they have no attachments. Because they have no attachments, they realize Nirvāṇa for themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”</td>
