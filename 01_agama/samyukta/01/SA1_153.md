### 153 (41). Five Turns

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates: The acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … the acquired aggregate of consciousness. I truly know these five acquired aggregates in five ways: I truly know form … form’s formation … form’s enjoyment … form’s trouble … truly know form’s escape. Thus, I truly know feeling … conception … volition … consciousness … consciousness’s formation … consciousness’s enjoyment … consciousness’s trouble … truly know consciousness’s escape.

28\. “Monks, if an ascetic or priest knows and sees form in this way and knows and sees the way to part with desire for it in this way, this is called the correct heading. If someone is correctly headed, I say that they have entered. <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and consciousness are likewise.</em>
{:#p28}

29\. “If an ascetic or priest truly knows and sees form, then disillusionment with form arises. Parting with desire for it, they don’t produce contaminants, and the mind becomes liberated. If someone’s mind becomes liberated, then it’s consistent. It being consistent, the religious life is established. Someone established in the religious life is free of another’s control. This is called the end of suffering. <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and consciousness is likewise.</em>”
{:#p29}

30\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
