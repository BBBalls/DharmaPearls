### 9. Not Knowing (4)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When you don’t know or understand form and don’t become free of desire for it, the mind isn’t liberated, and it’s not possible to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death. Thus, when you don’t know or understand feeling … perception … volition … consciousness and don’t become free of desire for it, the mind isn’t liberated, and it’s not possible to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death.
{:#p2}

3\. “Monks, if you know and understand form and become free of desire for it, the mind is liberated, and it’s possible to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death. Thus, if you know and understand feeling … perception … volition … consciousness and become free of desire for it, the mind is liberated, and it’s possible to transcend the fear of birth, old age, illness, and death.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This sūtra is similar to [SN 22.24](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.24){:target="_blank"} and parallel with SĀ 2.9. [\[back\]](#ref1)
