<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 24 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 30 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0005b05" target="_blank">T99.2.5b5-27</a>). It’s nearly identical to the previous <em>sūtra</em> (<a href="SA1_29.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.29</a>). The difference is that it occurs at a different location, and the Buddha here asks Rāhula the question rather than Rāhula bringing the question to the Buddha. As result, the two <em>sūtra</em>s appear to be different accounts of the same event. See the notes to SĀ 1.29 for more about other parallels that apply to both <em>sūtra</em>s. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>the Dharma lord, guide, and refuge</em>. C. 世尊為法主、為導、為覆. This triple epithet used to praise the Buddha as an authoritative source of the Dharma is found in many EBTs, but the translations in C. vary somewhat. This first occurrence of it in SĀ is unique to this <em>sūtra</em>. Elsewhere in SĀ, we find it a few more times translated instead as “the Bhagavān is the Dharma root, Dharma eye, and Dharma basis” (e.g. at T99.2.21a27: 世尊為法根、法眼、法依). In MĀ, the translation was “the Bhagavān is the Dharma source, the Bhagavān is the Dharma lord, and the Dharma comes from the Bhagavān” (e.g. at T26.1.424b5: 世尊為法本，世尊為法主，法由世尊).<br/>
Turning to Pali parallels, we find the expression <em>bhagavaṁmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā bhagavaṁnettikā bhagavaṁpaṭisaraṇā</em> frequently in MN, SN, and AN (but not DN, interestingly). The three P. keywords are then <em>mūlaka</em> (“a root vegetable like the raddish, rooted in, springing from”), <em>nettika</em> (“a guide or forerunner”), and <em>paṭisaraṇa</em> (“shelter, help, protection”).<br/>
It’s more than a little fascinating to see that the first version found here in this <em>sūtra</em> matches the Pali version much better than the others we find in other Sarvāstivāda sources. 導 = <em>netthika</em> and 覆 = <em>paṭisaraṇa</em> almost literally as the second the third epithets. On the other hand, the other two versions that we find in SĀ and MĀ do have parallels to <em>mūlaka</em> as the first epithet.<br/>
Some of the confusion may derive from the fact that S. <em>netra</em> (= P. <em>netta</em>) can also mean “eye” as well as “guide.” This would explain SĀ’s second term changing from 導 to 眼. In S., <em>netrika</em> means “a conduit pipe for irrigation,” which is a reading for the P. as well. This is also what we see in the G. attestation <em>bhagavadanetriga</em> where G. <em>netriga</em> = P. <em>nettika</em>.<br/>
However, G. <em>bhagavatanetiya</em> is also found in an EĀ fragment. It seems possible that the older Prakrit texts used a word like G. <em>nediga</em> (“leader”), which would be equiv. to P. <em>netika</em>. It’s much less ambiguous and could have been Sanskritized to S. <em>netrika</em> in error (when it should be S. <em>netṛka</em>). Perhaps the two Prakrit words (P. <em>netika</em> and <em>nettika</em>) became interchangable due to being nearly homophones. It’s easy to see from this example why Buddhists over time decided to standardize their canons in a single language like Sanskrit or Pali. The situation had become quite confusing.<br/>
Finally, S. <em>pratisaraṇa</em> means “leaning or resting upon,” while <em>pratiśaraṇa</em> can mean “confidence in or to resort to.” This might explain the C. translation in SĀ changing from 覆 to 依. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
