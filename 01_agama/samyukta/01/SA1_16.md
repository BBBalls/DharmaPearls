    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Form is impermanent. What’s impermanent is painful, something painful is not self, and something that’s not self doesn’t belong to self, either. Observing it in this way is called a true observation. Thus, feeling … conception … volition … awareness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is painful, something painful is not self, and something that’s not self doesn’t belong to self, either. Observing it in this way is called true observation.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 10 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 16 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0002a12" target="_blank">T99.2.2a12-20</a>). It’s a variant of the previous one (<a href="SA1_15.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.15</a>), and both are parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.15" target="_blank">SN 22.15</a> and similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.16" target="_blank">SN 22.16-17</a>. See the notes to <a href="SA1_15.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.15</a> for more discussion of these parallels.[<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>this is liberation</em>. C. 是等解脫. The parallel passage in <a href="SA1_18.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.18</a> reads 是等<strong>為</strong>解脫, which makes a bit more sense than 等解脫. It means that liberation from the five aggregates (是等, “these things”) is liberation from suffering. As the <cite>Taisho</cite> reads here, I would take 等解脫 to mean “complete” or “thorough liberation” (S. *<em>sama</em> or <em>sam-</em> + <em>(vi)mokṣa</em>?). But I think this is a case of inattentive copying leading to minor omissions. In this case, 為 was lost.[<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
