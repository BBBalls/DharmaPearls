    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that there was a minor dispute in the assembly, and the Bhagavān had scolded the monks because of it. Early in the morning, he put on his robe and took his bowl into the city to solicit alms. After eating, he left [the city,] and he put away his robe and bowl and washed his feet [upon returning]. He went into Andha Forest and sat under a tree. While quietly contemplating alone there, he thought, “There was a minor dispute in the assembly, and I scolded the monks. Still, there’s a group of junior monks in that assembly who left home not long ago, and they haven’t seen their great teacher. Perhaps they’ll be regretful and feel sad and unhappy. I’ve felt sympathy for these monks for a long night. I’ll go back now and bring that assembly together out of sympathy for them.”</td>

    <td class="ch" title='t125.2.71c22'>時，大梵王知佛心念。 如力士屈伸臂頃，從梵天沒，住於佛前。 而白佛言： 「如是，世尊！如是，善逝！ 責諸比丘以少諍事故。 於彼眾中多有年少比丘出家未久，不見大師。 或起悔心，愁憂不樂。 世尊長夜哀愍。 攝受眾僧！ 善哉，世尊，願今當還攝諸比丘！」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. At the time, King Mahābrahmā knew what the Buddha was thinking. In the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm, he disappeared from the Brahma Heaven and stood before the Buddha. He said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān! Yes, Sugata! You scolded the monks because of that minor dispute. There’s a group of junior monks in that assembly who left home not long ago and haven’t seen their great teacher. They might be regretful and feel sad and unhappy. The Bhagavān has had sympathy for them for a long night. Bring that assembly together! It would be good, Bhagavān, if you would please return and gather the monks!”</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. The Bhagavān then silently agreed out of sympathy for Brahmā. When he knew that the Buddha had silently agreed to this, Mahābrahmā bowed to the Buddha, circled him clockwise three times, and instantly disappeared.</td>

    <td id='p5'>5. Soon after Mahābrahmā had departed, the Bhagavān returned to Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove. He spread out his sitting mat, sat up straight in his seat, and gave a subtle sign<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> to the monks that they could come and respectfully see him. The monks then came to visit the Buddha. Blushing in shame, they bowed at the Buddha’s feet and withdrew to sit at one side.</td>

    <td id='p6'>6. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Those people who leave home live a lowly life. They cut off their hair, carry a bowl, and go from home to home soliciting alms like someone with a silence spell put on them. The reason they do this is to seek the supreme goal and go beyond birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, and trouble to the final end to suffering. Good sons, you didn’t leave home because you were sent by the king or a criminal, not because of creditors, not because of fear, and not because you lost your livelihood. Didn’t you leave home precisely to be freed from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain and not for these other reasons?”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 272 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 55 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0071c14" target="_blank">T99.2.71c14-2b13</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ma140" target="_blank">SN 22.80</a>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/iti91" target="_blank">MĀ 140</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Iti 91</a> both extract the Buddha’s teaching to the monks about the goal of the mendicant life without presenting the story of how it came to be taught found here.<br/>
This story is remarkable in that the Buddha appears to behave like most people, having emotional reactions that aren’t necessarily perfect. It clashes somewhat with the image of the deified Buddha of later Buddhism who serves as the model of a spiritually perfected being. Here, he is depicted as being quite disgusted with his monks arguing over insignificant matters and considering abandoning them. However, after cooling off in solitude, he decides that it would be best to return and try to teach them how to better behave.<br/>
The nature of his teaching suggests that some of the new monks were not adjusting to the mendicant lifestyle very well. SN 22.80 locates the sermon at Kapilavatthu, suggesting that perhaps this event occurred after the king of the Śakya tribe had ordered one son of each family to become a monk. The sudden influx of novices perhaps tried the patience of even a Buddha.<br/>
This version of the <em>sūtra</em> is generally expanded compared to SN 22.80, but it includes most of the details peculiar to it, such as the pairing of the four abodes of mindfulness with the signless <em>samādhi</em> as the recommended training. However, the mention of three unskillful perceptions (<em>vitarka</em> or <em>saṃkalpa</em>) is followed by three concepts (<em>samjñā</em>) that derive from them. This is not found in SN 22.80. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>gave a subtle sign</em>. C. 表現微相, P. <em>tathārūpaṁ iddhābhisaṅkhāraṁ</em>. The C. lit. means “display a little sign.” It’s difficult to imagine that it translated something equiv. to the Pali parallel. While not very specific, it could easily be interpreted to mean the wave of a hand or a nod of the head. In contrast, the P. parallel brings us back to an image of the Buddha as a supernatural being with miraculous powers rather than a human being. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>unskillful ways of perception.</em> C. 不善覺法, P. <em>akusalavitakkā</em>. Translating C. 覺 is never easy because English equivalents are easily misunderstood. Generally speaking, it refers to the initial recognition or taking notice of something, which can be a crude or shallow perception, or a sudden realization. English “noticing,” “discovering,” or “realizing” match the meaning of 覺 fairly well, but there aren’t many English nouns that are as clear. 覺 was used to capture this connotation of S. <em>vitarka</em> (G. <em>vitaka</em>, P. <em>vitakka</em>). In S., it meant a superficial kind of thinking or reflection that is doubtful or uncertain. One use of the English word “perception” refers to an initial or superficial recognition. That is my intended meaning when translating 覺 in this way.<br/>
This passage suggests that here the nature of <em>vitarka</em> is a rationalization of innumerable concepts (P. <em>saññā</em>, S. <em>saṃjñā</em>) of the same quality (here greed, hate, or harmfulness). This would suggest that it is not an initial sensory preception, but something like a prejudicial perception formed from past experience. This principle is illustrated here with three defilements that were also identified as bad intentions or aims (S. <em>saṃkalpa</em>, P. <em>saṅkappa</em>) in the eightfold path.<br/>
The additional commentary involving S. <em>saṃjñā</em> is absent from SN 22.80; it only mentions the same three <em>akusalavitakkā</em> (<em>kāmavitakka</em>, <em>byāpādavitakka</em>, and <em>vihiṁsāvitakka</em>). [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>three views</em>. SN 22.80 instead lists the two views of existence and non-existence. Here, three views about the relationship between one’s physical incarnation and spirit or self are given. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
