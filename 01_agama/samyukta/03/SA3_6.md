    <td id='p2'>2.  It was then that Venerable Śāriputra and Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila were staying on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. At the time, Venerable Śāriputra roused from meditation in the afternoon and went to visit Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila. After they had exchanged greetings and pleasantries, he sat to one side. He said to Mahākauṣṭhila, “I have a question to ask. Would you have some free time to answer it?”</td>

    <td id='p9'>9. Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila replied, “Now, I will explain it with an analogy, for intelligent people can understand something with analogies. Take the example of three reeds standing on open ground. They support each other in turn in order to stand upright. If one of them is removed, the other two won’t stand up. If two of them are removed, then the last one won’t stand up, either. They support each other in turn in order to stand upright. Awareness conditions name and form is the same way. They support each other in turn to arise and grow.”</td>

Among the Bhagavān’s disciples, there’s one who is wise, insightful, well trained, fearless, who sees the teaching of immortality, and who themselves realize the teaching of immortality. It’s Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila who has such profound eloquence about the goal. He can answer all sorts of difficult questions. He’s like a priceless jewel that worldly people carry on the crowns of their heads. Now, I carry Mahākauṣṭhila on the crown of my head in the same way.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 288 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 469 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0081a09" target="_blank">T99.2.81a9-c3</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.67" target="_blank">SN 12.67</a> and a Sanskrit fragment (SuttaCentral <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sf155" target="_blank">SF155</a>).<br/>
There are a number of minor differences between this version and SN 12.67. In the P., it’s Mahākoṭṭhita who approaches Sāriputta and asks him a question about the origin of old age and death. The location of the conversation also differs: Here, they were at Gṛdhrakūṭa, while in the P. version they were staying at Isipatana. When the analogy of the reeds is explained, it’s three reeds supporting each other here, and two reeds in SN 12.67. The Sanskrit version agrees with this version on many of these minor details (except for the number of reeds), indicating that it likely belonged to a Sarvāstivāda canon, prehaps the same one as the present text.
