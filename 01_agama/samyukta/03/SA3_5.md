    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I recall a past life before I had achieved perfect awakening. I was alone in a quiet place, focused in meditative reflection, when this thought occurred to me: ‘The existence of what causes old and death to exist? The condition of what causes old age and death to exist?’ When I properly considered it, this true [understanding] occurred to me immediately: ‘Birth exists because existence exists. Birth exists because of the condition of existence.’ <em>So it is with existence, grasping, craving, feeling, contact, the six senses, name and form.</em></td>

The condition of what causes the existence of name and form?’ When I properly considered it, this true [understanding] occurred to me immediately: ‘Name and form exist because awareness exists. Name and form exist because the condition of awareness exists.’ When I contemplated this, I stopped at awareness, turned back, and couldn’t go beyond it. That is, ‘name and form is conditioned by awareness, the six senses are conditioned by name and form, contact is conditioned by the six senses, feeling is conditioned by contact, craving is conditioned by feeling, grasping is conditioned by craving, existence is conditioned by grasping, birth is conditioned by existence, and old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain are conditioned by birth. Such is the way that the whole mass of suffering forms.’</td>

Contact ceases because the six senses cease. Feeling ceases because contact ceases. Craving ceases because feeling ceases. Grasping ceases because craving ceases.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 287 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 468 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0080b24" target="_blank">T99.2.80b24-81a8</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.65" target="_blank">SN 12.65</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ea38.4" target="_blank">EĀ 38.4</a>, and a Sanskrit fragment (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sf154" target="_blank">SF154</a>). SN 12.65 differs from this <em>sūtra</em> in that it presents the long dependent origination chain that ends with name and form. EĀ 38.4 is nearly identical with this text, The Sanskrit version, on the other hand, is nearly identical to SN 12.65. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>action</em>. C. 行, P. <em>saṅkhāra</em>, S. <em>saṁskāra</em>. Typically, this item in the chain of dependent origination is translated as volition, mental formations, or choices. This is largely because the item is interpreted as intention in the Theravāda tradition. However, this item included all three types of action in other Abhidharma traditions. That is to say, this item represented all the <em>karma</em> of past lives which caused the continuation of awareness into this life. This is true of the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0606b29" target="_blank">T1548.28.606b29-7a25</a>) of the Dharmaguptakas and the <cite>Abhidharma Dharmakāya</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1537_p0506a14" target="_blank">T1537.26.506a14-c29</a>) of the Sarvāstivādins. I’ve therefore translated this item as “action” in this context. This interpretation was probably why <em>saṁskāra</em> was translated as 行 in C., which means simply “action” or “conduct.” [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li></ol>
