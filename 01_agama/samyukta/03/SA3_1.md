    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If those things that are tying bonds are savored, thought about, and fetter the mind, then craving arises. Craving conditions grasping. Grasping conditions existence. Existence conditions birth. Birth conditions old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. Such is the way that the whole mass of suffering forms.</td>

Their mind won’t be bound up by them, and then craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, existence ceases. When existence ceases, birth ceases.

They burn it to ash and use it as fertilizer, it’s blown away by the wind, or it’s carried away by a stream. Monks, what do you think?

<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 283 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 464 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0079a25" target="_blank">T99.2.79a25-b22</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.57" target="_blank">SN 12.57</a>. Generally speaking, it’s very similar to SN 12.55-59, all of which use similes of trees and chains of dependent origination to illustrate the formation and cessation of suffering.
