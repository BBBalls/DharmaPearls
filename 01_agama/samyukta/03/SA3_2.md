It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If things that are grasped are savored, thought about, and fetter the mind, then one’s mind runs around chasing after name and form. Name and form conditions the six senses. The six senses condition contact. Contact conditions feeling. Feeling conditions craving. Craving conditions grasping. Grasping conditions existence. Existence conditions birth. Birth conditions old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. Such is the way the whole mass of suffering forms.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 284 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 465 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0079b23" target="_blank">T99.2.79b23-c26</a>). It combines elements found in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.55" target="_blank">SN 12.55</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.57" target="_blank">57</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.58" target="_blank">58</a>. Generally speaking, it’s very similar to SN 12.55-59, all of which use similes of trees and chains of dependent origination to illustrate the formation and cessation of suffering.
