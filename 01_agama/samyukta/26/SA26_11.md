<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 1329 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 1442 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0365c06" target="_blank">T99.2.365c6-7b4</a>). This was a well-known story of two <em>yakṣa</em> spirits paying a visit to the Buddha. According to the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite>, they were both <em>yakṣa</em> kings who lived in the mountains to the north and south of the Gaṅgā River plain. Each was named after the largest mountain in their mountain range (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0176c05" target="_blank">T1644.32.176c5-16</a>). We find similar mythological backstories for these spirits in Pali commentaries, which are summarized in the <a href="https://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/sa/satagira.htm" target="_blank">Dictionary
of Pali Proper Names</a>.<br/>
Many of the verses and the general outline in this <em>sūtra</em> are parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp1.9" target="_blank">Snp 1.9</a>, which consists only of verse. Direct parallels include <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0483c17" target="_blank">T100 no. 328</a> and a chapter of the Chinese <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0176c04" target="_blank">T1644.32.176c4-8b10</a>). A version of this <em>sūtra</em> is also incorporated as the first half of <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183b16" target="_blank"><em>sūtra</em> no. 13</a> of the Chinese <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> (the other half is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp4.14" target="_blank">Snp 4.14</a>).<br/>
Thus, there are five versions of this <em>sūtra</em> extant counting only Pali and Chinese versions, and there is most likely a version in Tibetan that I cannot access. These versions all follow the same outline, but verses have been added and their order has been jumbled somewhat from one version to the next. The additions are mostly superficial, adding only praise for the Buddha or reiterations. There is no great departure in meaning between the parallel verses, but the wordings change and vaguely equivalent expressions are substituted for each other.<br/>
My conclusion is that there was a very old oral tradition story in verse that predated all of these versions, and each extant version has developed in its own way over the centuries. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Sātāgiri and Haimavata</em>. C. 娑多耆利天神 (EMC. sa-ta-gii-lɪi + “heavenly spirit” = Pr. <em>satagiri yakṣa</em>), 醯魔波低天神 (EMC. hei-mua-pua-tei  + “heavenly spirit” = G. <em>hemavati yakṣa</em>), P. <em>sātāgiri yakkha … hemavata yakkha</em>, S. <em>sātāgiri</em> or <em>śātāgiri</em> and <em>haimavata</em>. Edgerton notes that <em>sātāgiri</em> was spelled in a variety of ways in BHS sources (<em>sātā-</em>, <em>śātā-</em>, <em>śāta-</em>, or <em>śata-</em>). Both were identified as <em>yakṣa</em> spirits in S. and P. sources, so I would assume that “heavenly spirit” (天神) was a translation of the same.<br/>
In two of the C. parallels, one or both names were translated. In T100, <em>sātāgiri</em> was translated as “seven sacred mountains” (七岳) and <em>haimavata</em> was translated as “snowy mountain” (雪山). In T198, <em>sātāgiri</em> was translated as “seven heads” (七頭). This suggests that the proper S. word for <em>sātāgiri</em> would be <em>saptagiri</em> and the proper P. word would be <em>sattagiri</em>. Both cases, however, appear to preserve older Pr. spellings. E.g., the proper G. spelling of “seven mountains” would have been <em>satagiri</em>. It’s not difficult to imagine that the various spellings in BHS sources were erroneous convertions from a language like G. to S. I’ve adopted the most common forms of these names found in BHS sources. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>lotus flower</em>. C. 波曇摩華 (EMC. pua-dəm-mua = Pr. <em>paduma</em>), G. <em>paduma</em>, P. <em>paduma</em>, S. <em>padma</em>. The <em>padma</em> is the red, or pink, variety of lotus flower. These plants were exotic to the Chinese audience, hence the translit. of their names. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4">This prose narrative of the two spirits making a promise and then discovering two treasures is shared by all the parallels if we include the Pali commentaries. It must be very old but wasn’t part of the original verse composition. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5"><em>from what Arhat</em>. In the other C. parallels, Haimavata asks who the Arhat is that Sātāgira has found. In light of this, I have adopted the alternate reading that changes 從<strong>阿</strong>羅漢受 to 從<strong>何</strong>羅漢受, which converts it into a question about the Arhat involved.<br/>
In Snp 1.9 (v.153), the verses open with Sātāgira bidding Hemavata to visit the Buddha on the sabbath day. The first couplet is nearly identical to that of this verse. The other three parallels all begin with a similar question from Haimavata, but the verses are composed differently. SA2.328 has expanded the initial verse to three couplets (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484a02" target="_blank">T100.2.484a2-4</a>), and it praises the full moon like the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version does (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183b29" target="_blank">T198.4.183b29-c1</a>). The <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177b05" target="_blank">T1644.32.177b5-6</a>) is also somewhat different, referencing the meeting of the four god kings on the sabbath day. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6">These verses are not found in Snp 1.9. The best match for Sātāgiri’s response here is in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177b08" target="_blank">T1644.32.177b8-13</a>). The <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c02" target="_blank">T198.4.183c2-7</a>) and SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484a06" target="_blank">T100.2.484a6-10</a>) share the same basic meaning. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n7">This Q&A is equivalent to Snp 1.9 v.154-5. It’s also found in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177b20" target="_blank">T1644.32.177b20-4</a>), the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c08" target="_blank">T198.4.183c8-10</a>), and SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484a11" target="_blank">T100.2.484a11-7</a>). The point that all versions share is the question and confirmation that the Buddha is impartial towards all sentient beings. This point has been expanded on in different ways. This version emphasizes the Buddha’s role as a savior of beings. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n8">This Q&A is equivalent to Snp 1.9 v.162-3. In the Pali version, this question occurs after several questions about the Buddha’s ethical conduct. It similarly occurs after such questions in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177c14" target="_blank">T1644.32.177c14-9</a>), the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c21" target="_blank">T198.4.183c21-4</a>), and SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484b10" target="_blank">T100.2.484b10-5</a>). Aside from the question being moved to an earlier point in the conversation in this version, all the parallels of this Q&A are very similar. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n9">This Q&A is equivalent to Snp 1.9 v.163A-B. In the Pali version, the first verse is not a question, and it’s not explicit who is speaking, but the assumption is that the first is Hemavata and the next is Sātāgira.<br/>
In the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177c21" target="_blank">T1644.32.177c21-5</a>), the first verse is Haimavata praising the Buddha, and then Sātāgiri replies with several verses of praise. They then decide to visit the Buddha.<br/>
There is only the first verse in the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c25" target="_blank">T198.4.183c25-6</a>). There, the praises that follow are much briefer, and then the spirits visit the Buddha.<br/>
Like Snp 1.9, these two verses are praises made by both spirits in SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484b16" target="_blank">T100.2.484b16-21</a>). The conversation then moves on to more questions before they visit the Buddha. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n10">This Q&A is parallel with Snp 1.9 v.156-7. There are very similar the verses found in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177c02" target="_blank">T1644.32.177c2-7</a>) and the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c11" target="_blank">T198.4.183c11-4</a>). In SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484a18" target="_blank">T100.2.484a18-24</a>), the question asks about speaking falsely rather than taking what’s not given. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</li>

<li id="n13">This Q&A doesn’t have a direct parallel in Snp 1.9. The first couplet matches that of v.174, which is the Buddha’s answer to a question about crossing the flood. The situation is the same in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0178a25" target="_blank">T1644.32.178a25-6</a>), the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0184a17" target="_blank">T198.4.184a17-8</a>), and SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484c28" target="_blank">T100.2.484c28-9</a>).

<li id="n14">These two verses are parallel with Snp 1.9 v.162-3. A slightly different version was placed in the beginning of the conversation in this version, but apparently the verse was also left here in its original place, resulting in a duplication. It’s not grammatically clear that the first verse is a question, though it is introduced as one, and the parallels are all questions. So I have translated it accordingly. The parallels in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177c14" target="_blank">T1644.32.177c14-9</a>), the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c21" target="_blank">T198.4.183c21-4</a>), and SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484b10" target="_blank">T100.2.484b10-5</a>) only occur at this later point in the conversation. [<a href="#ref14">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n15">These two verses are parallel with Snp 1.9 v.163A-B. As with the previous verses, this is a repeat of verses found at the beginning of the exchange, but here it is not a Q&A. This repetition doesn’t happen in the other parallels.<br/>
Parallel verses are also in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177c21" target="_blank">T1644.32.177c21-5</a>), the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c25" target="_blank">T198.4.183c25-6</a>), and SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484b16" target="_blank">T100.2.484b16-21</a>).

<li id="n16"><em>calves like an antelope deer</em>. C. 伊尼延鹿𨄔 (EMC. ɪi-ṇɪi/nei-yiɛn + “deer” + “calves”), G. <em>enijaṃgha</em>, P. <em>eṇijaṅgha</em>, S. <em>aiṇeyajaṅgha</em>. The C. is both a translit. and a transl. of the same term. It would appear that the <em>-jaṃgha-</em> had become a <em>-yan-</em>, and the final syllable was dropped. The C. term 𨄔, which translates S. <em>jaṅgha</em> is obscure and could mean the heel of the foot or the calves of the lower leg. We can see from the Indic equiv. how it was intended to be read.

<li id="n17">The first two couplets of this verse are parallel with Snp 1.9 v.165. Here, Haimavata suggests they visit the Buddha, while in Snp 1.9 it appears to be Sātāgira, though it is not explicit who is speaking from verses 163A to 167.<br/>
In the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0177c23" target="_blank">T1644.32.177c23-9</a>), it is Sātāgiri who finishes the exchange with praise for the Buddha. There is no parallel for this verse included, nor do those verses resemble their counterparts in Snp 1.9.<br/>
In the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> version (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c27" target="_blank">T198.4.183c27-8</a>), there is a parallel for this verse praising the Buddha, though it is difficult to tell which spirits says it.<br/>
In SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484b22" target="_blank">T100.2.484b22-5</a>), we also find a parallel verse spoken by Haimavata. It is the closest to what we find here in this text. [<a href="#ref17">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n18">The first verse is a repeat of the praise in Snp 1.9 v.165. The second verse includes the similes of a lion and a <em>nāga</em> (which presumably means an elephant here), which are found in Snp 1.9 v.166. The simile of a lion is mentioned in the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0183c29" target="_blank">T198.4.183c29</a>) and the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0178a05" target="_blank">T1644.32.178a5-6</a>) parallels. None of these similes of praise are repeated when Haimavata addresses the Buddha in the SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484b28" target="_blank">T100.2.484b28-9</a>).

<li id="n19">This Q&A is parallel with Snp 1.9 v.170-2, which is the second Q&A with the Buddha. The first verse of questions is a little different in Pali, but the Buddha’s answer is nearly identical. The parallel Q&A in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T32n1644_p0178a13" target="_blank">T1644.32.178a13-20</a>) is nearly identical to the Pali and is the second Q&A in that version. In the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0184a07" target="_blank">T198.4.184a7-10</a>), the question verse is the same as we find here, but the Buddha’s answer is quite different. In the SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484c01" target="_blank">T100.2.484c1-9</a>), both the question and answer closely match what we find here in this text.

<li id="n20">This Q&A is not found in Snp 1.9 or in the <cite>Lokasthāna Abhidharma</cite>. There does appear to be a parallel in the <cite>Arthavargīya</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T04n0198_p0184a07" target="_blank">T198.4.184a21-5</a>) version, but it is somewhat more cryptic, only mentioning “six abodes” which may well mean the six <em>āyatana</em>s. We find the closest match for this Q&A in SA2.328 (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0100_p0484c10" target="_blank">T100.2.484c10-6</a>). [<a href="#ref20">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n21"><em>combine in the world.</em> C. 世和合, P. <em>kubbati santhavaṁ</em>. The P. means “make arise in.” It’s of interest to note that there is an alt. reading in P. changing <em>santhavaṁ</em> to <em>sandhavaṁ</em>. It is not a word in P., but P. does have the verb <em>sandhāpana</em> (“combination”) derived from the verb <em>sandahati</em> (“connect, put together”). The parallel in T1644 reads 數數習有處, “repeatedly habituates to having a dwelling.” I cannot help but notice that other similar words like <em>sandhāvati</em> (“transmigrate”) or saṇṭhapeti (“settle in”) could result in such a meaning.<br/>
<em>make the world cease.</em> C. 令世滅, P. <em>loko vihaññati</em>. The P. means “world troubled in what.” A simple change in the spelling, however, results in <em>vihanati</em>, which can mean “put an end to, remove.” Two of the other parallels (T1644 and T198) agree with the Pali meaning, while SA2.328 agrees with this version.<br/>
These cases illustrate the way that drifting pronunciations appear to be responsible for sometimes significant changes in meaning, which only become clear to us in these old translations. [<a href="#ref21">back</a>]</li>

<li id="n24"><em>confidence</em>. C. 正信. I read this C. term as a translation of S. <em>saṃprasāda</em>, where <em>saṃ-</em> (“complete”) has been read as an abbrev. of G. <em>saṃma</em> (“correct”) by the translator.
