### 21 (766). Arising of the Noble Path (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Suppose a monk’s right view is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. When this had yet to happen, it didn’t happen except by the discipline of the Sugata … <em>likewise up to right samādhi</em>. Suppose his right view is pure, cleansed, without fault, and free of afflictions. When this had yet to happen, it could happen … <em>likewise up to right samādhi</em>.”
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p3}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is reconstituted according to a variant note that follows [SĀ 23.20](SA13_20.html){:target="_blank"}, which replaces “Buddha” with “Sugata.” It’s parallel to [SN 45.15](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.15){:target="_blank"} and [17](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.17){:target="_blank"}.
