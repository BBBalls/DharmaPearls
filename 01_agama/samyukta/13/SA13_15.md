### 15. Correct Men and Great Men

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.
{:#p1}

2\. At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain the correct man and the great man.[\[2\]](#n1){:#ref2} Listen closely and well consider it. What is a correct man? It means a correct man’s accomplishment of right view and a correct man’s accomplishment of right intention, right speech, right action, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called a correct man. What is the great man? It means the great man’s accomplishment of right view and a great man’s accomplishment of right intention, right speech, right action, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called a great man.”
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.
{:#p3}

### Notes
1. {:#n1}This sutra is reconstituted from a description that follows SA 13.14 at 200a22. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}<em>Correct man and great man</em>. These are literal translations of 正士 and 大士. They were likely translations of sat-puruṣa and mahā-puruṣa. [\[back\]](#ref2)
