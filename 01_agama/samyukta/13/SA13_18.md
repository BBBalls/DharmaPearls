### 18 (764). Cultivation of the Noble Path

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will explain the cultivation of the noble eightfold path. Listen closely and consider it well.
{:#p2}

3\. “What is the cultivation of the noble eightfold path? Here, a monk cultivates right view, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation … cultivates right intention … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right method … right mindfulness … right samādhi, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation. This is called cultivating the noble eightfold path.”
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
