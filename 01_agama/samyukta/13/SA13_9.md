### 9 (756). Immortality (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There’s the expression ‘immortal.’ What is it that’s called ‘immortal’? ‘Immortal’ is the name of a realm, but I take it to be the end of the contaminants of existence. That’s a clear explanation of this name.”
{:#p2}

3\. The monks said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps to attaining immortality when cultivated and cultivated often?”
{:#p3}

The Buddha addressed the monk, “There is. It’s known as the noble eightfold path, which is right view … right samādhi.”

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is reconstituted from a description of variants found after [SĀ 13.7](SA13_7.html){: target="_blank"}. It is a variant of [SĀ 13.6](SA13_6.html){: target="_blank"}, in which the Buddha questions the monks rather than being asked a question by the monk Ariṣṭa. It’s partially parallel to [SN 45.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.7){: target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
