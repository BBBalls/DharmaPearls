### 16. The Noble End of Contaminants

1\. Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain the noble end of contaminants. What is the noble end of contaminants? It means the non-trainee’s accomplishment of right view up to the non-trainee’s accomplishment of right concentration. This is called the noble end of contaminants.”
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.
