### 19. Past and Future Cultivation

1\. Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will explain a monk’s past cultivation of the noble eightfold path and future cultivation of the noble eightfold path.” *And so on [like the previous sutra].*
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.
