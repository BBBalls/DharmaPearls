### 19 (765). Past and Future Cultivation

1\. Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will explain a monk’s past cultivation of the noble eightfold path and future cultivation of the noble eightfold path. [Listen closely and consider it well.]”
{:#p2}

3\. [“What is the cultivation of the noble eightfold path? Here, a monk cultivates right view, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation … cultivates right intention … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right method … right mindfulness … right samādhi, relying on seclusion, the lack of desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation. This is called cultivating the noble eightfold path.”] [\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1}
{:#p3}

4\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} The Chinese translator indicates an abbreviation from the opening to the closing statement. I’ve reconstituted it with material from the previous sūtra ([SĀ 13.18](SA13_18.html){: target="_blank"}). [\[back\]](#ref1)
