### 14 (761). Trainees and Adepts

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain the trainee and the adept. Listen closely and consider it well. What is a trainee? It means a trainee’s accomplishment of right view … right intention … right speech … right action … right method … right mindfulness … accomplishment of right samādhi. This is called a trainee. What is an adept? It means an adept’s accomplishment of right view … right intention … right speech … right action … right method … right mindfulness … accomplishment of right samādhi. This is called an adept.”
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p3}

### Notes

1. {:#n1}This sūtra is parallel to [SN 45.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.13){:target="_blank"}, but the Pali sutta only mentions the trainee in relation to the eightfold path. [\[back\]](#ref1)
