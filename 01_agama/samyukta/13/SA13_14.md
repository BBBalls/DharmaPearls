### 14. Trainees and Non-Trainees

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.
{:#p1}

2\. At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain the trainee and non-trainee. Listen closely and well consider it. What is a trainee? It means a trainee’s accomplishment of right view and a trainee’s accomplishment of right intention, right speech, right action, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called a trainee. What is a non-trainee? It means a non-trainee’s accomplishment of right view and a non-trainee’s accomplishment of right intention, right speech, right action, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called a non-trainee.”
{:#p2}

3\. After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p3}

### Notes
1. {:#n1}This sutra is parallel to [<em>SN</em> 45.13](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.13){:target="_blank"}, but it only mentions the trainee in relation to the eightfold path. [\[back\]](#ref1)
