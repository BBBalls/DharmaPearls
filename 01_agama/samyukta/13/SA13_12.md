### 12. Sensation

1\. Thus have I heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Śrāvastī at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks,  “There are three sensations that are impermanent, conditioned, and dependently arisen. What are the three? They are pleasant sensations, painful sensations, and sensations that are neither pleasant nor painful.”
{:#p2}

3\. The monks asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps that put an end of these three sensations when cultivated and cultivated often?”
{:#p3}

4\. The Buddha told the monks, “There is a path and steps that put an end to these three sensations when cultivated and cultivated often. What is that path and those steps that put an end to these three sensations when cultivated and cultivated often?”
{:#p4}

5\. The Buddha told the monks, “They are the noble eightfold path and right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.”
{:#p5}

6\. After the Buddha had taught this discourse, the monks who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p6}
