### 6. Immortality

1. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2. There was then a monk named Ariṣṭa who went to the Buddha, prostrated at his feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, there’s the expression ‘immortal.’[\[2\]](#n1){:#ref2} What is it that’s called ‘immortal’?”
{:#p2}

Buddha told Ariṣṭa, “’Immortal’ is the name of a realm, but I take it to be the end of the contaminants of existence. That’s a clear explanation of this name.”

3. The monk Ariṣṭa said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps to attaining immortality when they are cultivated and cultivated often?”
{:#p3}

The Buddha addressed the monk, “There is. It’s known as the noble eightfold path, which is right view … right concentration.”

4. After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes
1. {:#n1} This discourse is partially parallel with [SN 45.7](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.7){: target="_blank"}, which contains a question about the “deathless” (P. amata) and equating it with the end of desire, anger, and delusion. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} The Chinese translates Skt. amṛta as ‘sweet dew’ 甘露, which was a mythical substance in Chinese legends. Amṛta was probably the inspiration for the Greek myth of ambrosia, as both were the food of the gods that gave them immortality. [\[back\]](#ref2)
