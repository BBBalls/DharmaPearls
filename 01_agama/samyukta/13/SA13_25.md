### 25. Wrong and Right

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta Grove of Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You must part with wrong views; you must stop wrong views. If stopping wrong views wasn’t possible, then I would never say that you must part with and stop wrong views. It’s because wrong views can be stopped that I say monks should part with wrong views. If they don’t part with wrong views, then wrong views will make them undertake what’s aimless, unbeneficial, and painful. I therefore say you must part with wrong views. *Thus, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration are likewise explained.*
{: #p2}

3\. “Monks, after you part with wrong views, you must cultivate right views. If cultivating right views wasn’t possible, I would never say that you must cultivate right views. It’s because right views can be cultivated that I say monks must cultivate right views. If they don’t cultivate right views, they will undertake what’s aimless, unbeneficial, and painful. Because not cultivating right views undertakes what’s aimless, unbeneficial, and painful, I therefore say you must cultivate right views. Because they are purposeful and beneficial, you’ll always attain well-being. Therefore, monks, you must cultivate right views. *Thus, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration are likewise explained.*”
{: #p3}

4\. After the Buddha taught this sūtra, the monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved.
