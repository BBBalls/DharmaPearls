# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 12: The Single Entry Path
### 9. Skin

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Someone taking profit is a serious thing, not an easy thing, for it prevents a person from reaching the unconditioned abode. Why is that? The reward of profit cuts into a person’s skin. Cutting through skin, it cuts into their flesh. Cutting into their flesh, it cuts into their bones. Cutting into bone, it cuts into their marrow.
{:#p2}

3\. “Therefore, monks, in this way, you should know that profit is a very serious thing. If thoughts of profit have yet to arise, then don’t produce them. If they’ve already arisen, then work to stop them. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
