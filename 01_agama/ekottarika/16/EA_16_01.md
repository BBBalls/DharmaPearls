    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.578a14'>爾時，尊者難陀在舍衛城象華園中。 是時，尊者難陀在閑靜處，便生是念： 「如來出世甚為難遇。 億劫乃出，實不可見。 如來久遠長夜時乃出耳。 猶如優曇鉢花時乃出現，此亦如是。 如來出世甚為難遇。 億劫乃出，實不可見。 此處亦難遇： 一切諸行悉休息止，愛盡無餘，亦無染污，滅盡泥洹。」</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. At the time, Venerable Nanda was staying in Nāgapuṣpa Park<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> near the city of Śrāvastī. While residing in a secluded place, Venerable Nanda had this thought: “It’s so difficult to meet a Tathāgata when he appears in the world. It takes a million eons for him to appear, during which time he truly cannot be seen. It’s just a very long night until he appears. It’s like the time it takes for the <em>udumbara</em> flower to appear. It’s so difficult to meet a Tathāgata when he appears in the world. It takes a million eons for him to appear, during which time he truly cannot be seen. And there are other things that are hard to encounter: All actions coming to a stop, the end of craving without remainder, the lack of defilement, and the complete cessation of <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. The Śākyan woman Sundarī rejoiced and celebrated when she heard what that god said, and she was unable to control herself. She dressed herself up, decorated the rooms of her house, prepared fine seats, and danced to music, just as she had when Nanda lived at home.</td>

    <td id='p5'>5. Then, King Prasenajit was attending a meeting in his discussion hall when he heard that the monk Nanda had renounced the Dharma robes and would return to working for his family. The reason for this was that a god in the sky had told this to Nanda’s wife.</td>

    <td id='p6'>6. When he heard this said, King Presenajit felt aggrieved. He rode his white elephant to that park. Arriving there, he waded into Lake Nāgapuṣpa. Seeing him from afar, he walked up to Venerable Nanda, bowed his head at his feet, and then sat to one side.</td>

    <td id='p8'>8. King Prasenajit replied, “Venerable, you ought to know that while I was attending a meeting in my discussion hall, I heard that the Venerable had discarded the Dharma robes and returned to wearing white clothes. Having heard that, I came here because I was worried about the Venerable. What instruction might he have?”</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.578b9'>是時，難陀含笑徐告王曰： 「不見、不聞，大王何故作此語耶？ 大王豈不從如來邊聞：我諸結已除，生死已盡，梵行已立，所作已辦？ 更不復受胞胎，如實而知？ 今成阿羅漢，心得解脫。」</td>
    <td id='p9'>9. With an easy smile, Nanda then told the King, “Why does the King say this without seeing or hearing it himself? Hasn’t the King heard it from the Tathāgata that I’ve removed the bonds, that for me birth and death is ended, that I’ve established the religious life, and that I’ve accomplished the task? That I truly know that I won’t return to a womb again? I’ve become an <em>arhat</em>, and now my mind is liberated.”</td>

    <td id='p10'>10. The King replied, “I haven’t heard from the Tathāgata that the monk Nanda … has ended birth and death … has become an <em>arhat</em>, and his mind is liberated. The reason I said this was that a god came to the Śākyan woman Sundarī and told it to her. When she heard about it, your wife Sundarī danced, played music, mended her clothes and ornaments, and prepared seats. When I heard about it, I came here to the Venerable.”</td>

    <td id='p11'>11. Venerable Nanda told the King, “Why does the Great King say this without witnessing or hearing it himself? There aren’t any ascetics or priests who don’t enjoy the happiness of respite, the happiness of being well gone, the happiness of the ascetic, and the happiness of <em>nirvāṇa</em>. They don’t contemplate the firepit of lustful desire. It wouldn’t be the case that they would go back to that.</td>

    <td id='p12'>12. “Bones are like a chain, and flesh is like a pile of stones. Like a sword coated in honey, greed brings a little profit, but the trouble later can’t be foreseen.

    <td id='p13'>13. “It wouldn’t be the case that their minds would be addicted to that. If someone doesn’t contemplate that desire as a firepit … bitter fruit, but they want to cross the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance, they won’t be able to do it. If someone hasn’t crossed the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance, but they want to gain entry to the realm of remainderless <em>nirvāṇa</em>, to <em>parinirvāṇa</em>, they won’t be able to do it.</td>

    <td id='p14'>14. “Great King, you should know that this is surely the case for ascetics and priests who investigate the happiness of respite, the happiness of being well gone, the happiness of the ascetic, and the happiness of <em>nirvāṇa</em>. They understand from their investigations that the firepit of lustful desire is like a chain of bones, a pile of flesh, a sword coated in honey, a branch broken by an abundance of fruit, a loan that’s due, a sword tree, a poisonous tree, or a poisonous herb. They all investigate and comprehend that this is the case. Having fully understood it, they know what produces the fire of desire, and then they surely can cross the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance. They will surely have crossed the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance.</td>

    <td id='p15'>15. “How is it, Great King? What did you see and what did you know when you said that about me? Great King, I’ve now become an <em>arhat</em>.

    <td id='p16'>16. Feeling joy in his heart, a good thought arose in King Prasenajit, and he said to Venerable Nanda, “I have not even a hair’s breadth of doubt about it. Now that I know the Venerable has become an <em>arhat</em>, I must take my leave and return to the many affairs of state.”</td>

    <td id='p17'>17. King Prasenajit rose from his seat, bowed at Nanda’s feet, and departed. A moment after he had left, the Māra King came to Venerable Nanda.  Hovering in the sky, he addressed Nanda in verse:</td>

<li id="n2"><p><em>Nāgapuṣpa Park</em>. C. 象華園. Presumably, C. 象華 (lit. “elephant flower”) is a lit. translation of S. <em>nāgapuṣpa</em> (G. <em>nagapuṣpa</em>). This was probably an ancient name of the Indian Ironwood tree (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesua_ferrea" target="_blank"><em>Mesua ferrea</em></a>), the flowers of which figured as gifts in past life stories about previous <em>buddha</em>s in Pali commentaries. S. <em>nāgapuṣpikā</em> was also the name of a kind of yellow jasmine, but a park was more likely to be named after a tree. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Śākyan woman Sundarī</em>. C. 孫陀利釋種女, S. <em>sundarī śākyakanyā</em>. Nanda was the Buddha’s half-brother (by a different mother). Most Buddhist stories about his becoming a monk claim that he was engaged to be married when the Buddha convinced him to leave the lay life. These sources disagree as to this woman’s name, however. The Theravāda tradition says she was Janapadakalyānī Nandā. A Sanskrit tradition says she was named Yaśodharā. In the present tradition, she was apparently named Sundarī. It isn’t clear whether Nanda had actually married her in this version of events. It would seem so since she had remained single while he was a monk in this story, as is often the case in stories of monks having encounters with former romantic interests. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>an indifferent manner</em>. C. 諸根澹泊. I’m reading 諸根 to mean one’s face and limbs rather than the sense faculties (sight, hearing, etc.). This is a less common meaning of the word, which is most often used when someone sees the Buddha and notices how serene he appears. That reading fits this passage better to me. If we read 諸根 with its more common meaning, the passage would mean “senses that are indifferent,” and at the end of the paragraph “senses that are indifferent.” [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
