    <td id='p3'>3. It was then that a group of monks visited the Bhagavān, bowed their heads at his feet, and sat to one side. That group of monks said to the Bhagavān, “The monk Rāhula has accepted and cultivated the precepts. He hasn’t had any occasion to violate them, but he is still not liberated from the contaminated mind.”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0581b15" target="_blank">T125.2.580b15-25</a>. I’m not aware of any direct parallels for this <em>sūtra</em>. It’s interesting, though, that it would make sense for this <em>sūtra</em> to be the prelude to EĀ 17.1, in which the Buddha decides to give Rāhula more advanced teachings. Yet, a chapter division has been placed between the two so that the next <em>sūtra</em> could serve as the heading for Chapter 17. It seems possible that they were originally parts of the same story.
