    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two powers. What are the two powers? They are the power of acceptance and the power of consideration. Supposing that I didn’t have these two powers, I would never have achieved the supreme, correct, and complete awakening. Moreover, without these two powers, I would never have practiced asceticism for six years in Uruvilva. Nor would I have been able to defeat the Māra foe and achieve the supreme and correct awakening while sitting at the site of awakening.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> I did have the power of acceptance and the power of consideration, and so I was able to defeat Māra’s host and achieve the supreme and correct awakening while sitting at the site of awakening.</td>

    <td id='p3'>3. “Therefore, monks, you must pursue the methods to cultivate these two powers, which are the power of acceptance and power of consideration. Then, you’ll achieve the awakening of the stream-enterer, the once-returner, the non-returner, and the <em>arhat</em>. You’ll then <em>parinirvāṇa</em> in the realm of <em>nirvāṇa</em> without remainder. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</td>

I’m not aware of a direct parallel for this <em>sūtra</em>, but <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20" target="_blank">AN 2.11-13</a> do speak of two powers, one of which is consideration (<em>paṭisaṅkhāna</em>). Here, consideration is intended to mean to consider, not to be considerate. More than likely, this <em>sūtra</em> is a variant on that same theme of two powers. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>supreme and correct awakening.</em> C. 無上、正真之道. Or, perhaps “path” instead of “awakening.” 道 (as in the Dao) was used to translate <em>bodhi</em>, or it could be read as “path” (the ordinary meaning of 道). This makes for ambiguous passages at times in Buddhist translations when it isn’t clear which is intended. In this passage, the confusion is increased by the use of 覺 ("awakening") to translate <em>bodhi</em> in the previous sentence. All in all, it seems more likely to me that 覺 and 道 are being used interchangeably given that EĀ is full of these kinds of errors and inconsistencies. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
