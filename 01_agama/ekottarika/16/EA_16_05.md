    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.580a19'>世尊告彼： 「云何名為不善？云何名為善？ 所謂殺生為不善，不殺為善。 不與取為不善，與取為善。 婬泆為不善，不婬為善。 妄語為不善，不妄語為善。 綺語為不善，不綺語為善。 兩舌為不善，不兩舌為善。 鬪亂彼此為不善，不鬪亂彼此為善。 貪他為不善，不貪他為善。 起恚為不善，不起恚為善。 邪見為不善，正見為善。</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. The Buddha told them, “What is called unskillful [conduct], and what is called skillful [conduct]? Killing beings is unskillful, and not killing is skillful. Taking what’s not given is unskillful, and taking what’s given is skillful. Debauchery is unskillful, and celibacy is skillful. False speech is unskillful, and not speaking falsely is skillful. Flattery is unskillful, and unflattering speech is skillful. Duplicity is unskillful, and not being duplicitous is skillful. Creating conflict with this group and another is unskillful, and not creating conflict with this group and another is skillful. Desiring others is unskillful, and not desiring others is skillful.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Becoming angry is unskillful, and not becoming angry is skillful. Wrong views are unskillful, and right views are skillful.”</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. “Thus, monks, someone who has practiced these evils falls to an animal birth, to the hungry ghosts, or into hell. Someone who practices these virtues is born among humans, up in heaven, or among the <em>asura</em>s of a good destiny. Therefore, monks, you must stay away from evil conduct and cultivate good conduct. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</td>
