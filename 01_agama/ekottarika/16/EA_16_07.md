    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.580b18'>爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「彼云何名燭明者？ 所謂貪婬、瞋恚、愚癡盡。 彼云何名為由燭趣道之業？ 所謂正見、正治、正語、正業、正命、正方便、正念、正三昧。 是謂由燭趣道之業。 我由此已說燭明，亦說由燭趣道之業，如來所應為者。 今已周訖。 善念、諷誦，勿有懈怠。 今不行者，後悔無及。」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “What is it that’s called candlelight? That refers to ending lust, anger, and delusion. What is it that’s called the deeds of the path along which that candle leads? They are right view, right control, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right <em>samādhi</em>. These are called the deeds of the path along which that candle leads. I’ve taught the monks about the candlelight and also taught them about the deeds of the path along which that candle leads as a Tathāgata should. Now, I am finished. Remember and recite it well, and don’t be lazy about it. If this isn’t done now, there’ll be no comparison for your regret later.”</td>
