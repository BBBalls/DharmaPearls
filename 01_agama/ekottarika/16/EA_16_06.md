    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.580b3'>爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「我當與汝等說微妙法，初善、中善、至竟亦善，有義、有味得修具足梵行之法，所謂二法也。 諦聽！諦聽，善思念之。 吾當與汝具足說之。」</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will teach all of you two things about the subtle Dharma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, and that has the content and expression that fully cultivates the way of the religious life. Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will give you a full explanation of this.”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.580b6'>諸比丘對曰： 「如是，世尊！」 是時，諸比丘從佛受教。</td>
    <td>The monks replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.” The monks then accepted the Buddha’s teaching.</td>

They are wrong view and right view, wrong control and right control, wrong speech and right speech, wrong action and right action, wrong livelihood and right livelihood, wrong method and right method, wrong mindfulness and right mindfulness, and wrong <em>samādhi</em> and right <em>samādhi</em>.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> These, monks, are called the two things. Now, I’ve given you an explanation of these two things as a Tāthagata should, and now I am finished. Remember, contemplate, and recite it well,<sup id="ref3"><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and don’t be lazy about it. If this isn’t done now, there’ll be no comparison for your regret later.”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0580b02" target="_blank">T125.2.580b2-14</a>. I’m not aware of any direct parallels for this <em>sūtra</em>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>right control … right method.</em> C. 正治⋯正方便, P. <em>sammā saṅkappa … sammā vāyāma</em>. These two items, which are typically translated as “right intention” or “thought” and “right effort,” seem to have been difficult words to translate to Chinese. This is evidenced by the inconsistency between translations compared to the other six items in the eightfold path. It might also indicate that the words in the Indic texts varied, but I have not seen direct evidence of this. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>remember, contemplate, and recite it well.</em> C. 善念、觀、誦. The next <em>sūtra</em>, EĀ 16.7, has the same conclusion, but there the phrase reads “remember and recite (from memory) well” (善念、諷誦). The passage here may well be corrupt and should be amended, but I have left it as-is for the time being. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
