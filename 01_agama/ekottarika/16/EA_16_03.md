They go to someone for a teaching and spend time serving that teacher.

I’ve not found a parallel for this <em>sūtra</em>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.77" target="_blank">AN 10.77</a> likens a bad monk to a crow, whereas here the crow is employed as a positive analogy that’s contrasted with the pig.

<li id="n2"><p><em>impure things</em>. C. 不淨. Lit. “impure” or “unclean.” In this context, I would take it mean something considered inedible by people like carrion, dung, or refuse. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
