# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 8: Asura
### 8. Belief

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When one person who appears in the world, a light then shines on both gods and humans, and then they believe in precepts, learning, generosity, and wisdom. It’s like the light of the autumn full moon that’s immaculate and illuminates everything. This is likewise. When the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Correctly and Perfectly Awakened One appears in the world and shines upon both gods and humans, then they believe in precepts, learning, generosity, and wisdom. He’s like the full moon illuminating everything.
{:#p2}

3\. “Therefore, monks, be reverent in the presence of the Tathāgata. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}
