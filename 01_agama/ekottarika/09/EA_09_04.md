# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 9: The Only Son
### 4. The Mind (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t see a single thing as quick as the mind. There’s no comparison for it. The mind drops one thing and picks up another when it isn’t focused and settled, just like a monkey. The mind is likewise when that previous and subsequent perceptions of its thoughts aren’t the same. Therefore, monks, ordinary people are unable to observe the origin of their mind’s thinking.
{:#p2}

3\. “Therefore, monks, one should control their thinking to lead their mind to the good path. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved of it.
{:#p4}
