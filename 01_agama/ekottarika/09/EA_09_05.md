# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 9: The Only Son
### 5. Downfall

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I often observe the thoughts in a person’s mind and see: ‘This person will fall to Hell[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} in the time it takes to flex their arm.’ Why is that? Because of their evil thoughts, their mind becomes ill, and they fall down into Hell.”
{:#p2}

3\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p3}

* {:.verse}“Take the example of a person\\
Who harbors hateful notions.\\
Now, I’ll tell you monks\\
The meaning of this in detail.

* {:.verse}Suppose their life were to end\\
Right here and now.\\
In that case, they would enter Hell\\
Because of their defiled mind.

4\. “Therefore, monks, one should control their mind and not do defiled things. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p4}

5\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p5}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This sūtra is parallel to [AN 1.43](https://www.suttacentral.net/an1.43/en/sujato){:target="_blank"} and [Iti 20](https://www.suttacentral.net/iti20/en/sujato){:target="_blank"}. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2} *Hell*. C. 泥㴝 or 泥犂 (MC. nei-lei = G. *nara[ga]*), P/S. *naraka*. The Chinese transliterates the Indic word that was equivalent to English “Hell” as a place of punishment in the afterlife. *Naraka* literally means a pit, so a literal translation to English could be “the Pit.” The next occurrence of “Hell,” however, translates the Indic name to Chinese as 地獄 (lit. “earth prison”).
