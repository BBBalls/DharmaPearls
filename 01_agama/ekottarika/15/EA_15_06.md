# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 15: Existence and Inexistence
### 6. Two Signs of a Fool

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A fool has these two signs and appearances. What are the two? Here, a fool who is incapable of accomplishing something still undertakes it, or they grow tired and abandon something they’re close to accomplishing. These, monks, are said to be two signs and appearances of a fool.
{:#p2}

3\. “Furthermore, monks, a wise person has two signs and appearances. What are the two? Here, a wise person doesn’t undertake something that they can’t accomplish, and they don’t abandon something that they’re close to accomplishing …
{:#p3}

4\. “Therefore, monks, these two signs and appearances of a fool should be abandoned, and you should remember and cultivate these two signs and appearances of a wise person. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p4}

5\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This <em>sūtra</em> is of the same type as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.134" target="_blank">AN 2.134-137</a>, but it presents a different version of the two signs of a fool and a wise person. [\[back\]](#ref1)
