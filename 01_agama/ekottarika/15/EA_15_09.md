# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 15: Existence and Inexistence
### 9. Honoring the Tathāgata’s Shrine

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two things that honor the Tathāgata’s shrine when one contemplates and focuses on them single-mindedly. What are the two things? The Tathāgata has no equals among worldly people, and the Tathāgata possesses great kindness and great compassion, being mindful of every direction. Monks, these are two things that honor the Tathāgata’s shrine when one contemplates and focuses on them single-mindedly. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p2}

3\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
