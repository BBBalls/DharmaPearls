# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 15: Existence and Inexistence
### 7. Honoring the Tathāgata

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two things that honor the Tathāgata when one contemplates and focuses on them single-mindedly. What are the two things? The first is wisdom, and the second is complete cessation.[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} Monks, these things honor the Tathāgata when one contemplates and focuses on them single-mindedly. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p2}

3\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p3}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} <em>complete cessation</em>. C. 滅盡. This likely translated either S. <em>nirodha</em> or <em>nirvāṇa</em>. [\[back\]](#ref1)
