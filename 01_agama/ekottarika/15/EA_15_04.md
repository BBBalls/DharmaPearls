# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 15: Existence and Inexistence
### 4. Two Kinds of Work

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two kinds of work.[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} What are the two? They are Dharma work and material work. Monks, the best kind of work doesn’t go beyond the Dharma work.
{:#p2}

3\. Therefore, monks, you should always train in Dharma work and not in material work. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} <em>two kinds of work</em>. C. 二業. C. 業 could be read as “deeds,” but it seems awkward in this context. [\[back\]](#ref1)
