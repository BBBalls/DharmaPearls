# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 13: Profit
### 2. Enjoyment of Desires

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Should you cease one thing, I’ll bear witness that you’ve achieved the fruit of spiritual knowledge and the end of the contaminants. What is that one thing? It’s enjoyment of desires. Therefore, monks, should you cease the enjoyment of desires, I’ll bear witness that you’ve achieved the fruit of spiritual knowledge and the end of the contaminants.”
{:#p2}

3\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p3}

* {:.verse}“Sentient beings attached to enjoyments\\
Fall to bad destinations when they die.\\
If you should abandon these desires now,\\
You’ll achieve the fruit of the arhats.

4\. “Therefore, monks, you must always abandon notions that are attached to enjoyment [of desires]. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p4}

5\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
