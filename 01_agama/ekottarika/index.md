# The Numerical Discourses
#### (Skt. *Ekottarika Āgama*; Ch. <span class="ch">增壹阿含</span>)

The *Numerical Discourses* is a collection of Āgama sutras that was translated to Chinese by Dharmanandi and edited by a team headed by Gautama Saṃghadeva. The exact date of translation is unclear, but the text itself retains the older style of translators prior to Gautama Saṃghadeva’s translation of the *Medium Discourses*.

The *Numerical Discourses* collection is controversial because it contains a number of passages of clearly Mahāyāna  inspiration, yet it also represents an early canonical tradition that doesn’t align with the Theravāda or Sarvâstivāda. As such, it appears to be a piece of another tradition that offers an alternative glimpse of early Buddhist texts in India.

Like the Theravāda *Aṅguttara Nikāya*, the *Numerical Discourses* is arranged in a numerical order starting with topics with one item and ending with topics with eleven items. The sutras are arranged in 52 chapters.

Below is a list of translated sutras from the *The Numerical Discourses* that are currently available.
