# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 2: Ten Recollections
### 7. Calmness

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You should cultivate one thing and widely disseminate one thing. It readily achieves penetrating knowledge, removes myriad confused perceptions, wins the fruits of the ascetic, and brings about nirvāṇa. What is that one thing? It’s recollection of calmness. You should cultivate and widely disseminate this. It readily achieves penetrating knowledge, removes myriad confused perceptions, wins the fruits of the ascetic, and brings about nirvāṇa.
{: #p2}

3\. “Monks, you should cultivate this one thing and widely disseminated this one thing. Thus, monks, should you train.”
{: #p3}

4\. The monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
