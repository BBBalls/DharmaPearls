# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 11: The Non-Returner
### Heart (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “From the start, I do not see in this assembly a single thing that’s easily controlled and which brings a good result when its easily controlled. That thing is the heart.
{:#p2}

3\. “[Therefore,] monks, one should discern their heart and be well aware of its good roots. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}

### Notes

1. {:#n1} This and the previous <em>sūtra</em> are similar to those found in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.21-30/en/sujato" target="_blank">AN 1.21-30</a>. [\[back\]](#ref1)
