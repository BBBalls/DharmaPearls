## Chapter 11: The Non-Returner
### 1. Non-Returning

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone were to cease one thing, I’d bear witness that they’ve become a non-returner. What’s that one thing? It’s greed. Monks, you should cease greed, then I’ll bear witness that you’ve become non-returners.”
{:#p2}

3\. The Buddha then spoke this verse:
{:#p3}

* {:.verse}“The stain of greed\\
Makes sentient beings fall to bad destinies.\\
One should endeavor to abandon greed,\\
Then they’ll become a non-returner.”

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
