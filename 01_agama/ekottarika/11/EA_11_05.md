# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 11: The Non-Returner
### 5. Heart

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “From the start, I don’t see in this assembly a single thing that’s uncontrollable and which is sure to bring a result of suffering when its difficult to control. That thing is the heart. Monks, this heart is uncontrollable. When its difficult to gain control of it, it surely brings a result of suffering.
{:#p2}

3\. “Therefore, monks, one should discern their heart. They should pay attention to their heart and be well aware of its roots of goodness. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}
