# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 3: Broader Explanations
### 6. The Gods

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should cultivate one thing and disseminate one thing. After cultivating this one thing, they’ll become well known and achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments. They’ll attain the sweet-tasting dew and arrive at the unconditioned state. They then will achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about nirvāṇa themselves. What’s this one thing? It’s called recollecting the gods.”
{:#p2}

3\. The Buddha addressed the monks, “How does someone who cultivates the recollection of the gods become well known, achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state? How do they achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about nirvāṇa themselves?”
{:#p3}

4\. The monks then said to the Bhagavān, “What the Tathāgata says is the source of the teachings. Please, Bhagavān, explain the wonderful meaning of this for the monks. After we hear it from the Tathāgata, the monks will accept and retain it.”
{:#p4}

5\. The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will discern this for you in detail.”
{:#p5}

They replied, “Yes, Bhagavān.”

6\. Once the monks had accepted the teaching, the Bhagavān told them, “Suppose a monk sits cross-legged with correct posture and thought and fixes his attention on what’s in front of him. With no other idea, he focuses on recollecting the gods.
{:#p6}

7\. “Their bodies are made by being pure in body, speech, and mind, not performing polluted practices, and practicing the precepts. When they achieve those divine bodies, they shine with a light that nothing else can outshine. Those divine bodies are rewards for good deeds. One achieves a divine body by perfecting many such practices.
{:#p7}

8\. “This is how someone who cultivates the recollection of the gods will become well known,[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state. They’ll achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about nirvāṇa themselves.
{:#p8}

9\. “Therefore, monks, one should constantly recollect the gods and not part from it. Then, they’ll win these good virtues. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p9}

10\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

### Notes

1. {:#n1} *This is how … well known.* C. 如是，諸比丘，名曰念天。便得具足⋯. The Taisho edition appears to be corrupt, for it omits mention of becoming well known. Lit., it reads: “Thus, monks, is called ‘recollecting the gods.’ Then, attaining its perfection …”. I’ve translated the passage assuming that the original followed the format of the initial sūtras in this chapter (i.e., 「是謂，諸比丘，若念天者便有名譽⋯」). [\[back\]](#ref1)
