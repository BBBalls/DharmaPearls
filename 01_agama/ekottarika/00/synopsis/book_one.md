## The Book of Ones

### Summary

The Chinese translation of the *Ekottarika Āgama* (EĀ) doesn’t contain headings for the numerical divisions that we find in the *Aṅguttara Nikāya* (AN), but we can discern that it was organized in the same way. The *sūtra*s were arranged by the number of items in their main subject, which was usually a list. A “Book of Ones” through “Book of Elevens” is discernible, though there were many *sūtra*s inserted into the collection that didn’t fit the original rationale.

The Book of Ones spans Chapters 2-14 and consists of 307 *sūtra*s when we count the abbreviated *sūtra*s in Chapters 4-7 (each of which is actually a group of chapters). These four chapters contain lists of prominent disciples similar to what we find at AN 1.188-267. Counting them is a little misleading, however, because there were many more disciples listed than is found in AN.

The table below breaks the count down by chapter.

This is about half the *sūtra* count found in AN, which has 31 chapters and 627 *sutta*s in its Book of Ones. If we disregard the list of disciples, this Book of Ones has only 87 *sūtra*s compared to 547 *sutta*s in AN, making it only a sixth of the size of the Theravāda Book of Ones. 

This is a pattern that will hold throughout the collection: AN is much larger than this version of EĀ. Despite this size difference, EĀ and AN have broad similarities in both content and motif, as we shall see as we summarize the individual chapters. This points to the existence of an ancestor collection, or at least a shared pool of older *sūtra*s that both traditions have collected together in similar ways.

One difference that becomes apparent is that the chapter headings in EĀ are often not representative of a chapter’s contents. Rather, the chapter heading is usually the title of the first *sūtra* in the chapter. The first *sūtra* often appears to be an insertion that doesn’t match the theme of the chapter as a whole. The result is that these headings obscure the topics covered in each chapter.

Chapter 12 is a good example of this. It’s heading is “The Single-Entry Path,” which is the title of the first *sūtra* on the four abodes of mindfulness, but the remainder of the chapter doesn’t cover that subject. Instead, most of the *sūtra*s that follow serve as warnings against the danger of moral corruption of the religious life.

Another difference between EĀ and AN that’s noticable is that EĀ is in a greater state of disarray. While AN more neatly collects topics and motifs together into chapters, EA’s *sūtra*s are more scattered and disorganized. The scattering is not complete, however. On close inspection, chapter headings sometimes appear to have been moved when new *sūtra*s were inserted, causing the themes of the original chapters to straddle between existing chapters.

A good example of this is Chapter 12 and 13. The *uddāna* verse at the end of Chapter 13 references ten *sūtra*s found in both chapters, and it skips a few *sūtra*s in between. This makes it appear that one or two chapters were rearranged when a handful of texts were added. 

It seems likely that some of this disarray occurred after EĀ was translated to Chinese. Historical sources in China suggest that the initial translation was revised at least once, and that more than one recension circulated for quite some time. Be that as it may, many of the apparent insertions were present before it was translated, if the surviving *uddāna* verses are accurate. Thus, this version of EĀ that we have today is not in the best of shape, having passed through many centuries of sometimes uninterested curation to reach us. It nonetheless provides us with valuable insights about the development and diversity that existed in early-to-middle period Buddhism.

<h3 id="c2-3">Chapter 2-3: The Ten Recollections</h3>

These two chapters consist of twenty *sūtra*s, each of which is dedicated to one of the ten recollections. Chapter 2’s ten *sūtra*s use a common template to introduction each recollection only by name. Chapter 3’s ten sutras use a very similar template to present a definition of each recollection.

These chapters are a good example of one a common way the Book of Ones was populated with *sūtra*s: A list was divided into its individual items, each of which was used to create a *sūtra*. This same method occurs in AN in a number of instances including this one. AN 1 also has a chapter that uses the ten recollections to create a set of ten *sutta*s (AN 1.296-305).

This list of ten recollections follows a meaningful order: the three jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha), virtuous practices (precepts, generosity, and gods), and meditative practices (calming, mindfulness of breathing, mindfulness of the body, and contemplation of mortality). This could be viewed as three phases of Buddhist practice, moving from development of faith to virtuous behavior and meditative practice. In general, however, the commentary on these ten recollections in Chapter 3 takes the form of visualization exercises, indicating that the ten recollections formed the outline of a meditative program.

<h3 id="c4-7">Chapter 4-7: The Four Assemblies</h3>

Each of these chapters is a group of chapters dedicated to praising disciples belonging to one of the four assemblies. Chapter 4 consists of ten chapters praising a hundred monks. Chapter 5 consists of five chapters praising fifty nuns. Chapter 6 consists of four chapters praising forty laymen. Chapter 7 consists of three chapters praising thirty laywomen.

As such, this section of EĀ is remarkably similar to the parallel section in AN found at AN 1.188-267. In fact, the abbreviated format found in AN is replicated here in EĀ despite the fact that EĀ doesn't use this format elsewhere that drops the traditional intros and outros of the oral tradition *sūtra*s. This suggests that it must be a fairly old part of the Book of Ones. The major departure is that this part of EĀ is much larger than we find in AN, consisting of 220 passages vs. AN's 80 passages.

<h3 id="c8">Chapter 8: Asura</h3>

This chapter gets it's title from the first *sūtra*, which is a short mythological description of asuras. Here, *asura*s are described as the largest of beings, standing 84,000 *yojana*s tall, making it reasonable to call them titans. The Buddha describes how an *asura*s sometimes menaces the sun and moon, being so large that it can physically reach them. However, *asura*s can’t actually grab them but only make the sun and moon temporarily grow dim. This story, by the way, would appear to be a mythological explanation for lunar and solar eclipses. The Buddha employs it as an anology for Māra harassing and menancing his disciples but lacking the power to harm them.

The remainder of Chapter 8 is generally parallel to the One Person chapter of AN at AN 1.170-187. This type of *sūtra* extols the virtues of the Buddha by saying he is the only person to arise in the world possessing them. A tenth “one person” *sūtra* occurs at the end of Chapter 10, which might have been displaced when the Asura Sūtra was inserted here.
