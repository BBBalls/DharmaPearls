# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 10: The Guarded Mind
### 10. One Person

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When one person appears in the world, it increases the life spans of sentient beings and makes their complexions brighter, their health more vigorous, their happiness unsurpassed, and their voices gentle. Who is that one person? It’s the Tathāgata, the Arhat, and the Completely Awakened One. He is that one person who appears in the world and increases the life spans of sentient beings and makes their complexions brighter, their health more vigorous, their happiness unsurpassed, and their voices gentle.
{:#p2}

3\. “Therefore, monks, always focus and unify your mind on recollecting the Buddha. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p3}

4\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p4}
