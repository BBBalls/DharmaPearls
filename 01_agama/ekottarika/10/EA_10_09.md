# [The Numerical Discourses](../index.html)
## Chapter 10: The Guarded Mind
### 9. Bad Destinies

1\. Thus I have heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.
{:#p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk cultivates one thing, then he won’t be able to destroy the bad destinies and make a destiny that’s either good or nirvāṇa. What is the one thing that when cultivated isn’t able to destroy the bad destinies? It’s a heart that lacks sincere belief. Cultivating this one thing, one won’t destroy the bad destinies.
{:#p2}

3\. “What one thing when cultivated leads to a good place? That refers to a heart that practices sincere belief. Cultivating this one thing leads to a good place.
{:#p3}

4\. “What one thing when cultivated reaches nirvāṇa? That refers to the constant focus of mindfulness. Cultivating this thing reaches nirvāṇa.
{:#p4}

5\. “Therefore, monks, focus your thinking and be mindful of the roots of goodness. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”
{:#p5}

6\. When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.
{:#p6}
