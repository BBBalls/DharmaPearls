Having arrived there, he addressed Rāhula, “You should cultivate the teaching on breathing. By cultivating this teaching, whatever notions of grief that you have will be eliminated. You should also cultivate the notions of the foul discharges and impurities, and then whatever cravings you have will be entirely eliminated. Now, Rāhula, you should cultivate the thought of kindness. Having cultivated the thought of kindness, whatever hate you have will be eliminated. Now, Rāhula, you should cultivate the thought of compassion. Having cultivated the thought of compassion, whatever harmful thoughts you have will all be eliminated.

    <td id='p14'>14. When Rāhula contemplated thoughts of desire in this way, he became liberated and had no more of the myriad bad [and unskillful things]. While he noticed and examined things, he was mindful and maintained his joy and happiness, and he dwelled in the first meditation. Once noticing and examining things had subsided, he had an inner joy and a focused, unified mind. Without noticing or examining things, his <em>samādhi</em> was mindful and joyous as he dwelled in the second meditation. With no more joyous thoughts, he guarded himself and experienced the personal happiness that’s always sought by noble people and that’s equanimous, joyous, and mindful. He then dwelled in the third meditation. Once his pain and pleasure had ceased, he had no more grief. Without pain or pleasure, his equinimous mindfulness was pure, and he dwelled in the fourth meditation.</td>

The physical, mental, and verbal conduct of some sentient beings was bad. They slandered noble people, practiced wrong views, and performed actions of wrong view. When their bodies broke up and their lives ended, they entered hell. The physical, mental, and verbal conduct of some sentient beings was good. They didn’t slander noble people, always practiced right views, and performed actions of right view. When their bodies broke up and their lives ended, they were born in good places up in heaven.

He truly knew the formation of suffering, the end of suffering, and the escape from suffering when he examined them. Because he performed these contemplations, his mind was liberated from the contaminant of desire, and his mind was liberated from the contaminants of existence and ignorance. Once he was liberated, he then had knowledge that he was liberated: “Birth and death have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.” He truly knew that he would not be subject to another existence.

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0581c01" target="_blank">T125.2.581c1-2c19</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn62" target="_blank">MN 62</a>. See the notes below for comparisons of these two versions of this <em>sūtra</em>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>This introduction is essentially the same as what we find in MN 62, but there Rāhula doesn’t simply repeat the Buddha’s instructions. The most significant difference is that in MN 62, the Buddha tells Rāhula that the five aggregates are not self rather than impermanent. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>At this point, the story in MN 62 diverges from this version. There, it’s Sāriputta who happens upon Rāhula and advises him to practice the mindfulness of breathing. Rāhula then goes to the Buddha later in the day and asks for instruction on how to cultivate that practice. At that point, the Buddha teaches him a series of contemplations like the ones we find here in EĀ 17.1, with the addition of contemplations of five elements of the body (earth, water, fire, air, and space). After that, another set of contemplations are taught designed to develop equinimity.</p>
<p>Here, the Buddha gives Rāhula a program of contemplation subjects designed to counteract a set of unskillful mental qualities: Mindfulness of breathing to eliminate grief, the impurities to eliminate cravings, kindness to eliminate hate, compassion to eliminate harmful thoughts, joy to eliminate jealousy, and equanimity to eliminate pride. In MN 62, these contemplations are placed in a more-or-less reverse order: kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, impurity, impermanence, and mindfulness of breathing. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>This exchange of verses is not found in MN 62; however, it would make sense for a teacher to give a student a verse to memorize before leaving him to practice alone during the early oral tradition period of Buddhism. The verse would serve as a mnemonic key to recall the oral teaching that was received. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p>This version of the mindfulness of breathing is somewhat different in its details than the better known version that’s found in Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda sources. As such, it shows that there were alternative explanations of this particular practice. Here, the entire program of mindfulness is focused on observing the breath, the body, and finally when breathing is intentional (as opposed to autonomic or involuntary).</p>
<p>In the more well-known version, other contemplations and references to the four meditations are collected together that have little to do with breathing. It seems to be a similar situation as we find with the four abodes of mindfulness, where tangential or unrelated practices were added to the mindfulness of body.</p>
<p>MN 62 ends with this instruction given to Rāhula by the Buddha. Here in EĀ 17.1, Rāhula goes on to practice this mindfulness of breathing and the four meditations. He then attains the three knowledges of past lives, the rebirth of sentient beings, and the ending of the contaminants. He then becomes an <em>arhat</em>. The Buddha then declares to the monks that Rāhula is the best disciple at keeping precepts. This indicates that this <em>sūtra</em> belonged to a group of texts that provide back stories for disciples being called the best at certain virtues or skills.</p>
<p>The omission of Rāhula’s awakening in MN 62 might be explained by the fact that an alternative story about Rāhula becoming an <em>arhat</em> is found in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn147" target="_blank">MN 147</a>. MN 147 in turn is paralleled by the Sarvāstivāda version found at <a href="../../samyukta/02/SA2_57.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.57 (200)</a>. EĀ 17.1 and MN 62, on the other hand, have no parallel in the extant Sarvāstivāda canon.</p>
<p>Could it be that two contradictory stories about Rāhula’s awakening from EĀ and SĀ found their way into MN, and the Theravāda tradition resolved it by choosing MN 147 as their official version? It certainly would explain the abrupt end to MN 62. The fact that this version involves awakening through the four meditations (MN 147 does not) adds a potential controversy over whether Rāhula was an <em>arhat</em> liberated by wisdom or liberated in both ways.
