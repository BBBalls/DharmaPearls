    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.583a11'>爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「有此二法，在於世間，甚為煩惱。 云何為二法？ 所謂作眾惡本，起諸怨嫌，復不造善行諸德之本。 是謂，比丘，二法甚為煩惱。</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two things in the world that are very afflicting. What are the two things? They are creating the myriad roots of evil that produce resentments and not doing good actions that are the roots of virtue. These, monks, are two things that are very afflicting.</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t125.2.583a14'>「是故，諸比丘，當覺知此煩惱法，亦當覺知不煩惱法。 諸煩惱之法，當念斷除；不煩惱之法，當念修行。 如是，諸比丘，當作是學。」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. “Therefore, monks, you should recognize these afflicting things, and you should recognize things that aren’t afflicting. You should be mindful of afflicting things and eliminate them, and you should be mindful of things that aren’t afflicting and cultivate them. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</td>
