    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two people who appear in the world that are very difficult to become. Who are these two people? The Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One appears in the world and is very difficult to become. The noble wheel-turning king appears in the world and is very difficult to become. These, monks, are two people who appear in the world and are very difficult to become.”</td>

It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.52" target="_blank">AN 2.52</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.55" target="_blank">55</a>. None of the Pali <em>sutta</em>s have the exact expression that a <em>buddha</em> and a wheel-turning king are difficult to become, but this <em>sūtra</em> is variation of the same theme.
