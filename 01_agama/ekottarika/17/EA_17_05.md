    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There’s nothing respectable about any of the thoughts, destinations, and other actions of sentient beings with wrong views. They don’t delight the world’s people. Why is that? It’s because their wrong views aren’t good.</td>

When these seeds are planted in good soil, they sprout afterward and are just as bitter as before. Why is that? It’s because those seeds are the source of the bitterness.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>

There’s nothing respectable about the physical, verbal, and mental actions that they do, their destinations, their thoughts, or their evil actions. They don’t delight the world’s people. Why is that? It’s because their wrong views are bad and not good.</td>

<li id="n2"><p><em>Witlowgrass seed</em>. C. 葶藶子. This is a C. name for a type of grass commonly called yellow or draba Witlowgrass. What the original Indian text was referencing is not clear to me.</p>
<p><em>*pitavandi</em>. C. 畢地槃持 (EMC. piĕt-dii-buan-ḍɪei = Pr. <em>pidipande</em>?). There is no information that I can find for this translit., and it doesn’t resemble the examples that occur in the P. and S. parallels. It presumably is something edible that tastes bad, but exactly what it was has fallen into obscurity. The closest Indic word I can find is G. <em>pidavaṃnidaga</em> (S. <em>pītavarṇitaka</em>), which would simply mean “something yellow-colored.” I have reproduced the translit. as best as possible for the time being.</p> [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
