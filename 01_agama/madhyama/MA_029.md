In MN 9, this discourse is a lecture given by Sāriputta to an assembly of monks, but otherwise the content is very similar. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Squirrel Park in the Bamboo Grove.</em> C. <span class="ch">竹林、加蘭哆園</span>, P. <em>veḷuvana kalandakanivāpa</em>. This was a refuge created for squirrels to be fed regularly. There was a legend that it was created by a king after a squirrel woke him from a nap while a viper was slithering nearby. Feeling that he had been saved by a tree spirit in the guise of a squirrel, he decreed that the squirrels in the forest be fed as a repayment for their protection. Squirrels are famous for their bravery when combating snakes, being immune to their venom in many cases, and they bark warnings when they spot predators on the ground or in the air. It’s entirely possible that this legend was based on true events. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>Śāriputra.</em> C. 舍梨子 (EMC. ʃɪă-lɪi + “son” = Pr. <em>śariputra</em>), G. <em>śariputra</em>, P. <em>sāriputta</em>, S. <em>śāriputra</em>.<br/>
<em>Mahākauṣṭhila.</em> C. <span class="ch">大拘絺羅</span> (EMC. “great” + kɪu-ṭ‘ɪi-la = Pr. <em>Mahākoṭhila?</em>), G. ?, P. <em>mahākoṭṭhita</em>, S. <em>mahākauṣṭhila</em>. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4">C. <span class="ch">頗有事因此事，比丘成就見，得正見，於法得不壞淨，入正法耶？</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako sammādiṭṭhi hoti, ujugatāssa diṭṭhi, dhamme aveccappasādena samannāgato, āgato imaṁ saddhamman”ti?</em>, S. <em>āryaśrāvako ’smin dharmavinaye dṛṣṭisaṁpannaś ca bhavati, ṛjvyā ca dṛṣṭyā samanvāgato bhavati, buddhe cāvetyaprasādena samanvāgato bhavati, āgata imaṁ saddharmam upagata imaṁ saddharmam avaiti saddharmam ity ucyate</em>.<br/>
These three versions all share certain expressions and depart with each other in different ways. E.g., <span class="ch">成就見</span> = S. <em>dṛṣṭisaṁpanna</em> = G. <em>diṭhisaṃpaṃna</em>, but <span class="ch">不壞淨</span> = G. <em>abhejaprasada</em> but not P. <em>aveccappasāda</em> or S. <em>avetyaprasāda</em>. The S. version has the noble disciple placing their faith in the Buddha, rather than the Dharma. It also shares the expression “straight view” (<em>ṛjvyā ca dṛṣṭyā</em>) with the P. (<em>ujugatāssa diṭṭhi</em>). <span class="ch">正見</span> technically could mean “straight view,” but it seems an unlikely choice when there are better words in C. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5">In MN 9, what’s unskillful and skillful is defined as the ten unskillful and ten skillful deeds, which covers physical, verbal, and mental deeds. The S. edition agrees with our present text. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>portioned food, either crude or fine … food of contact … food of mental intention … food of awareness.</em> C. <span class="ch">摶食麤、細⋯更樂食⋯意思食⋯識食</span>, P. <em>kabaḷīkāro āhāro oḷāriko vā sukhumo vā … phasso … manosañcetanā … viññāṇaṁ</em>, S. <em>kabaḍiṁkāra āhāra audārikaḥ sūkṣmaś ca … sparśo … manaḥsañcetanā … vijñānaṁ.</em><br/>
It should be noted that Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma definitions of these four kinds of food were fairly prosaic in meaning, and generally referred to conditions for newly born beings to reach maturity. E.g., “food of contact” was explained using the example of birds needing to roost on their eggs for them to hatch (cf. <cite>Saṅgītiparyāya</cite>: <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1536_p0400b26" target="_blank">T1536.26.400b26-c5</a>). “Food of mental intention” was explained using the example of a sea turtle that buries her eggs on a sandy beach and returns to the sea. The turtles in the eggs think of their mother in order to hatch. If they don’t, then the eggs will die and spoil (cf. ibid.: <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1536_p0400c05" target="_blank">T1536.26.400c5-11</a>). “Food of awareness” is explained by citing the Buddha’s teaching to Phalguna when he tells him: “ … the food of awareness causes future birth to happen” (ibid.: <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1536_p0400c11" target="_blank">T1536.26.400c11-5</a>).<br/>
Thus, the upshot of these four kinds of food are that they support the birth and maturation of sentient beings. Ceasing them will bring an end to rebirth. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n7"><em>the contaminants of desire, contaminants of existence, and contaminant of ignorance.</em> C. <span class="ch">欲漏、有漏、無明漏</span>, S. <em>kāmāsravo bhavāsravo ’vidyāsravaḥ</em>. This section is placed at the end of the discourse in MN 9, presumably as a synonym for ignorance in the chain of dependent origination. In the present text and S. version, the final step of ignorance is left without a definition.<br/>
In Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, these three contaminants (C. <span class="ch">漏</span>, S. <em>āsrava</em>) were defined in this way: “The contaminants of desire are all the bonds, fetters, tendencies, subsidiary afflictions, and hindrances connected with the desire realm, except for ignorance. The contaminants of existence are all the bonds, fetters, tendencies, subsidiary afflictions, and hindrances connected with the form and formless realms, except for ignorance. The contaminant of ignorance is lack of knowledge about the three realms” (cf. <cite>Saṅgītiparyāya</cite>: <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1536_p0383a05" target="_blank">T1536.26.383a5-9</a>). [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n8"><em>there is suffering because of old age and death … suffering ceases when old age and death cease.</em> MN 9 here inserts definitions of the second the third noble truths; i.e., that craving brings about suffering, and suffering ceases when craving ceases. Here, the context of the chain of dependent origination in reverse is maintained, and so it instead says old age and death are what cause suffering to form or cease. The S. version agrees with MN 9 in this case. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n9"><em>desire existence, form existence, and formless existence.</em> The <cite>Dharmaskandha</cite> commentary on this step of dependent origination (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1537_p0512b26" target="_blank">T1537.26.512b26-c9</a>) notes two different interpretations found in <em>sūtra</em>s. The first is that existence refers to the five aggregates that exist in each of the three realms. The second is that the three existences refer to deeds that will have the result of bringing about a future life in one of the three realms. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n10"><em>grasping desires, grasping precepts, grasping views, and grasping self.</em> The <cite>Dharmaskandha</cite> commentary on this step of dependent origination (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1537_p0512b11" target="_blank">T1537.26.512b11-9</a>) defines these four graspings in this way: Grasping desires means all the bonds, fetters, tendencies, subsidiary afflictions, and hindrances connected with the desire realm, except for views. Grasping precepts means grasping precepts and rules to be pure, liberated, escape, and to transcend pleasure and pain. Grasping views means having personality view, extreme views, wrong views, and grasping to views. Grasping self means all the bonds, fetters, tendencies, subsidiary afflictions, and hindrances connected with the form or formless realms, except for views. Thus, we can see that here grasping desires and grasping self are nearly identical to the contaminants of desire and existence. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n11"><em>craving of desire, craving of form, and craving of formlessness.</em> The <cite>Dharmaskandha</cite> commentary on this step of dependent origination (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1537_p0512b11" target="_blank">T1537.26.510a13-2b25</a>) doesn’t define craving in these terms, though it does cite a <em>sūtra</em> passage that mentions craving of desires and existence, which is roughly equivalent, if we assume the craving of existence was divided into craving of form and formlessness to make three.<br/>
The three cravings do occur in the <cite>Saṅgītiparyāya</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1536_p0382b21" target="_blank">T1536.26.382b21-c12</a>), however. There, craving of desire is interpreted either as the greed, pursuit, and obsession with desires, the eighteen spheres, twelve senses, and five aggregates of the desire realm, or the five aggregates that exist from the Avici Hell up to the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven. The cravings of form and formlessness are similarly defined for their respective objects and realms of existence.<br/>
MN 9, like the <cite>Dharmaskandha</cite> commentary, defines craving in terms of craving for the six sense experiences. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n12"><em>four aggregates that aren’t form.</em> They would be feeling, conception, volition, and awareness. The Theravāda tradition differs in substituting contact, intention, and consideration for volition and awareness, which is the way the Dharmaguptaka tradition defined name, too. Thus, we see this doctrinal difference when comparing MN 9 with this text. The difference in the two viewpoints seems to be that for some Buddhists name and form represents the objects of mental experience, and so they must be seperate from the observing aspect of mind. For others, name and form was a shorthand for the five aggregates (i.e., a person), and so they defined it in terms that included mind in the category of name. [<a href="#ref12">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n13"><em>actions.</em> C. <span class="ch">行</span>, G. <em>saṃkhara</em>, P. <em>saṅkhāra</em>, S. <em>saṃskāra</em>. It’s initially confusing that the standard C. translation of S. <em>saṃskāra</em> was <span class="ch">行</span>, which simply means “action, practice, conduct.” Depending on context, <em>saṃskāra</em> often refers to volition, or will, as well as conditioned things. The situation becomes clearer when we investigate the ways in which <em>saṃskāra</em> was defined in the context of dependent origination. In the Theravāda interpretation, <em>saṅkhāra</em> represents past life intentions to commit actions that have resulted in the continuation of awareness into the present life. However, as we shall see, other exegetical traditions including the Sarvāstivāda interpreted <em>saṃskāra</em> to represent all types of actions (physical, verbal, and mental) in past lives that have resulted in the present life. The rationale is apparently that this past life <em>karma</em> is the conditioning that brings about the awareness that experiences this life. This is likely the reason for the C. trans. of <em>saṃskāra</em> as “action.” [<a href="#ref13">back</a>]</li>
