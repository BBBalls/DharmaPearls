# [The Medium Discourses](index.html)
## Chapter 5: Related to Cultivation
### 47. Precepts

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){: #ref1} One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk violates the precepts, that’s detrimental to having no regrets … gladness … joy … calmness … happiness … samādhi … true seeing and true knowing … disenchantment … lack of desire … liberation. If he doesn’t have liberation, that’s detrimental to nirvāṇa.
{: #p2}

3\. “If a monk observes the precepts, he readily cultivates having no regrets … gladness … joy … calmness … happiness … samādhi … true seeing and true knowing … disenchantment … lack of desire … liberation. If he has liberation, he readily cultivates nirvāṇa.”
{: #p3}

4\. The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
