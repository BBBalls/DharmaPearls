<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li id="n1">For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0577b02" target="_blank">T26.1.577b2-c13</a>. It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.53" target="_blank">AN 10.53</a>. These two texts are quite similar to <a href="MA_096.html" target="_blank">MĀ 96</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.55" target="_blank">AN 10.55</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>discuss</em>. C. 說, P. <em>vaṇṇayāmi</em>. In AN 10.53, the Buddha says he doesn’t praise abiding or retreating, but only growth in skillful qualities, whereas here he simply announces three topics that he’ll discuss for the monks. The C. could well translate the same word as the P. because <em>vaṇṇayāmi</em> can mean “comment on, interpret, explain” or “praise, extol.” AN 10.53 indicates the latter reading by negating the verb for the undesireable topics. This looks like an example of a single word being interpreted differently by separate traditions or dialects and the context being shaped to accomodate the chosen reading.<br/>
<em>in skillful qualities</em>. While the C. could be read as “good Dharma,” AN 10.53 reads <em>kusalesu dhammesu</em>, which is in the plural locative case. The list of character traits that will follows also confirms that this is the correct reading. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>faith, precepts, learning, generosity, wisdom, and eloquence, scriptures, and his attainments</em>. C. 篤信、禁戒、博聞、布施、智慧、辯才、阿含、及其所得, P. <em>saddhā sīla suta cāga paññā paṭibhāna</em>. This C. list is the same set of skillful qualities given in the definition of “knowing oneself” in <a href="MA_001.html" target="_blank">MĀ 1</a>. The list found in AN 10.53 is “faith, ethics, generosity, wisdom, and eloquence,” and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.68" target="_blank">AN 7.68</a> is the same except for the addition of “learning.” In general, the MĀ parallels have added two items: “scriptures” (<em>āgama</em>) and “attainments.” [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4">C.f. the corresponding passage in AN 10.53: “<em>abhijjhālu bahulaṁ viharāmi, byāpannacitto bahulaṁ viharāmi, thinamiddhapariyuṭṭhito bahulaṁ viharāmi, uddhato bahulaṁ viharāmi, vicikiccho bahulaṁ viharāmi, kodhano bahulaṁ viharāmi, saṅkiliṭṭhacitto bahulaṁ viharāmi, sāraddhakāyo bahulaṁ viharāmi, kusīto bahulaṁ viharāmi, asamāhito bahulaṁ viharāmī’ti, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tesaṁyeva pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya adhimatto chando ca vāyāmo ca ussāho ca ussoḷhī ca appaṭivānī ca sati ca sampajaññañca karaṇīyaṁ.</em>”<br/>
Generally speaking, the P. parallel has each item in adj. form, while the C. places each as the object of the main verb 為多行 (“have often practiced”). This and the negations using 無 indicate that the C. is translating nouns. Notes on my translation of each item are below:<br/>
<em>longing.</em> C. 增伺, P. <em>abhijjhālu</em>, S. <em>abhidhyālu</em>. The C. trans. here is the same as it is for S. <em>abhidhyā</em> (“longing”).<br/>
<em>hateful thoughts.</em> C. 瞋恚心, P. <em>byāpannacitta</em>, S. <em>vyāpannacitta</em>. In S., this word typically meant “malicious” or “evil-minded,” and the P. reading is the same. In MĀ, 瞋恚 usually translates S. <em>doṣa</em> (“hate, dislike”) in the context of the three roots of unskillfulness and S. <em>vyāpāda</em> in the context of the five hindrances, indicating that the two were considered equal synonyms. I’ve translated accordingly here.<br/>
<em>wrapped in sleepiness.</em> C. 睡眠纏, P. <em>thinamiddha pariyuṭṭhita</em>, S. <em>styānamiddha paryavasthita</em>. 睡眠 means “sleepiness” and 纏 means “wrapped up, captured,” which is an attested reading of <em>paryavasthita</em> in Tibetan translation as well. The P. and S. words were also interpreted as meaning “possessed by,” as in “possessed by a demon” as a way of explaining a temporary change in mood or personality.<br/>
<em>agitated arrogance.</em> C. 調貢高, P. <em>uddhata</em>, S. <em>uddhata</em>. There seems to have been some confusion in Indic languages between similarly pronounced words such as <em>uddhata</em>, <em>uddhacca</em>, and <em>udhṛta</em>. Many of these words were ambiguous, meaning “elevated, arrogant, or agitated” among other things. The reading of “agitation” appears to have derived from the fact that arrogant people are easily upset. Here, 調貢高 is strange because it seems to be a double translation of a word like <em>uddhata</em>: 調 (“agitation”) and 貢高 (“arrogance”). It’s possible that it was indeed a compound in the original, so I have translated it as it is. As an aside, 調 is an unintuitive term for “agitation, restlessness” in Buddhist Chinese, and there are often variant readings replacing it with the clearer alternative 掉. The basis for 調 as “restlessness” is unclear to me, unless the reading of “check, investigate” could represent the urge to check on distractions or chores, which anyone working at home will confirm is a form of restlessness.<br/>
<em>perplexity.</em> C. 疑惑, P. <em>vicikiccha</em>, S. <em>vicikitsā</em>. The C. lit. means “doubt and confusion.”<br/>
<em>physical violence.</em> C. 身諍, P. <em>sāraddhakāya</em>, S. <em>?</em>. The C. appears to match P. <em>sāraddhakāya</em>, though “physical” is placed in front of “violent.” “Violent, angry” is indeed a reading for P. <em>sāraddha</em>, but I have not located a clearly attested S. equivalent. It may have been <em>saṃrambha</em>.<br/>
<em>filthy thoughts.</em> C. 穢污心, P. <em>saṅkiliṭṭhacitta</em>, S. <em>saṃkliṣṭacitta</em>. I’ve translated 穢污 lit. as “filthy, dirty.”<br/>
<em>faith.</em> C. 信, P. <em>saddhā</em>, S. <em>śraddhā</em>.<br/>
<em>diligence … laziness.</em> C. 精進 … 懈怠, P. <em>kusīta … āraddhaviriya</em>, S. <em>kusīda … vīryārambha</em>. It’s unclear if the C. translates the same Indic words, but the P. presents them in the opposite order.<br/>
<em>settled.</em> C. 定, P/S. <em>samāhita</em>. It’s unclear whether the C. translates <em>samāhita</em> or <em>samādhi</em>. The two words were apparently considered equivalent.<br/>
<em>poor wisdom.</em> C. 惡慧, P. <em>duppañña</em>, S. <em>duṣprajña</em>. There are examples in other P. <em>sutta</em>s (e.g. AN 4.230) that present the list <em>assaddha, dussīla, kusīta, duppañña</em> (“faithless, unethical, lazy, and witless”), which seems to be incorporated into this larger list in MĀ 95. <em>Duppañña</em>, however, doesn’t end the parallel list in AN 10.53. Here, the C. seems to be a lit. trans. of this figurative expression for being foolish or stupid. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
