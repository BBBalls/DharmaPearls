<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0645b09" target="_blank">T26.1.645b9-c13</a>. It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.23" target="_blank">AN 4.23</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/iti112" target="_blank">Iti 112</a>. Both of the Pali parallels are identical with each other aside from a couple formatting differences.<br/>
The beginning of this <em>sūtra</em> is essentially the same as the Pali version. It applies an analysis very similar to that applied to suffering in the <cite>Turning the Dharma Wheel Sūtra</cite> (cf. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11" target="_blank">SN 56.11</a> and <a href="../samyukta/04/SA4_1.html" target="_blank">SĀ 4.1</a>). After that introduction, there is more variation between this text and the P. parallels, but the basic points are the same. Both this and the Pali version end with seven stanzas of verse, and they overlap strikingly in about two or three verses of this material. Overall, however, the degree of divergence suggests that both versions have had verses added to expand an originally shorter summary in different ways. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>The Tathagata himself has discovered the world … way of the world.</em> C. <span class="ch">如來自覺世間，亦為他說。如來知世間。如來自覺世間習，亦為他說。如來斷世間習。如來自覺世間滅，亦為他說。如來世間滅作證。如來自覺世間道跡，亦為他說。如來修世間道跡</span>. P. <em>Loko, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddho. Lokasmā tathāgato visaṁyutto. Lokasamudayo, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddho. Lokasamudayo tathāgatassa pahīno. Lokanirodho, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddho. Lokanirodho tathāgatassa sacchikato. Lokanirodhagāminī paṭipadā, bhikkhave, tathāgatena abhisambuddhā. Lokanirodhagāminī paṭipadā tathāgatassa bhāvitā.</em><br/>
These passages both present something very similar to what is found in SN 56.11 and SĀ 4.1, but here the format is more succinct. There are a few differences to note:
<ul><li>Here in MĀ 137, the Buddha describes these four insights as “self discovered” (<span class="ch">自覺</span> ≈ <em>abhisambuddha</em>) and “taught for others” (missing from P.).</li>
<li>AN 4.23 says that the Tathāgata is “detached” from the world instead of “knows” it (<em>visaṁyutta</em> ≠ 知).</li>
<li>MĀ 137 doesn’t specify that the “way of the world” (<span class="ch">世間道跡</span>) leads to its cessation, but the P. version does (<em>lokanirodhagāminī paṭipadā</em>).</li></ul>
Thus, both versions depart from the templates of SN 56.11 and SĀ 4.1 in a couple minor ways. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>the Tathāgata is the one who is sacred … not false.</em> C. <span class="ch">如來是梵有。如來至冷有。無煩亦無熱。真諦、不虛有</span>. I’ve chosen to translate <span class="ch">梵</span> (S. <em>brāhma</em>) as an adj. here since it would make little sense for the Buddha to call himself the god Brahmā. The verb <span class="ch">有</span> (“to exist, possess”) appended to the end of this and the following phrases appears to be a lit. trans. of Indic grammar. It likely translated S. <em>bhavati</em> (G. <em>bhodi</em>, P. <em>hoti</em>), which functioned as a copular verb here. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4">This prose section generally agrees with AN 4.23 in its content, but it isn’t organized as a list of reasons why the Buddha is called a Tathāgata. Instead, it simply praises his teaching as true and beyond the ken of other teachers. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5">Compare this with verse 1 in AN 4.23: <em>Sabbaṁ lokaṁ abhiññāya, sabbaṁ loke yathātathaṁ; Sabbaṁ lokaṁ visaṁyutto, sabbaloke anūpayo.</em> [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6">Compare this first couplet with the first couplet of verse 2 in AN 4.23: <em>Sa ve sabbābhibhū dhīro, sabbaganthappamocano.</em> [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n7">Compare this third line with the third line of verse 3 in AN 4.23: <em>Sabbakammakkhayaṁ patto.</em> [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n8">Compare this couplet with the first couplet of verse 5 in AN 4.23: <em>Iti devā manussā ca, ye buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gatā.</em> [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</li>
