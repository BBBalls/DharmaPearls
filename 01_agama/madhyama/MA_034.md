    <td id='p2'>2. At the time, there was a heretic who had been a good friend of Venerable Bakula before the latter had left home.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> He visited Venerable Bakula then while out for a walk in the afternoon. After they had exchanged greetings, that man of another training withdrew to sit at one side and said, “Venerable Bakula, I would like to ask a question if you would permit me.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0475a11" target="_blank">T26.1.475a11-c15</a>. The only known parallel is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn124" target="_blank">MN 124</a>.</p>
<p>While the introduction here indicates that these events occurred shortly after the Buddha’s <em>parinirvāṇa</em>, MN 124 is silent on this point. Bhikkhu Bodhi reports that the commentary to MN 124 says that it was added to the canon a hundred years after the Buddha. This might explain the interlinear commentary declaring Bākula’s unprecedented qualities. The Buddha wasn’t present to declare it himself, so the compilers added their own declaration. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>a heretic who had been a good friend of Venerable Bakula.</em> Bakula’s interlocutor goes nameless throughout this <em>sūtra</em>. He is called “[someone of] another training” or “a heterodox [person]” <span class="ch">異學</span>, which I take to be a translation of S. <em>tīrthika</em>. This was an epithet that seems to usually apply to adherents of other ascetic traditions. In MN 124, he is identified as the naked ascetic Kassapa. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>This is called an unprecedented quality of Venerable Bakula.</em> According to the Pali commentary to MN 124, this statement is the voice of the compilers of the canon during the second council a hundred years after the Buddha’s <em>parinirvāṇa</em>. Here in this version, it’s clear that there is a change in speaker because Bakula is spoken of in the third person. I’ve therefore set it off in italics as a comment by the narrator.</p>
<p>This statement by Bakula that he had no pride about his virtue is repeated twice more below. These additional statements are not found in MN 124. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>MN 124 adds the lack of notions of ill-will (P. <em>byāpādasañña</em>), cruelty (<em>vihiṁsāsañña</em>), and thoughts (<em>vitakka</em>) of desire, ill-will, and cruelty after this virtue. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p>MN 124 begins with the same two items in this section, and then continues with dyeing robes, sewing robes during the robe-making ceremony, and wandering in search of material for another monk making robes. Despite their differences, both versions arrive at six robe-related virtues. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>This section combines items regarding soliciting alms and interacting with women. Here, there’s a total of seven items, while in MN 124 these two topics are covered by ten items. Strictly speaking, the two versions only share three items in common: Not accepting invitations, not having looked at a woman, and not having entered a nun’s quarters. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p>This section of three items corresponds with seven items in MN 124. They only share the one item of not having had a novice. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p>This version and MN 124 share both of these items, but the illustration for the first differs between them. It should be noted that never being ill is the quality for which Bakula was famous in addition to being an hermit ascetic. See, e.g., passages in the <cite>Commentary to the Great Perfection of Wisdom</cite> @ <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T25n1509_p0223c27" target="_blank">223c27</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T25n1509_p0238a05" target="_blank">238a5</a>, and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T25n1509_p0271b18" target="_blank">271b18</a>.</p>
<p><em>yellow myrobalan fruit.</em> C. <span class="ch">訶梨勒</span> (EMC. ha-lɪi-lək = Pr. <em>harilak[i]</em>?), P/S. <em>harītakī</em>. The C. translit. appears to be a Prakrit variant of the well-known S. <em>harītakī</em>, which was the name for the medicinal fruit of the yellow myrobalan tree in India. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p>MN 124 contains two items that correspond roughly to this section: Not leaning on a board or preparing a cot. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p>MN 124 has two single-item sections here: One is never having spent a rainy season in a village, and the second is being awakening on the eighth day after leaving home. After those two sections, the ascetic Kassapa receives ordination from Bakula, practices diligently, and becomes an <em>arhat</em>. None of these details are found here in MĀ 34. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li>
