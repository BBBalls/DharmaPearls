# [The Medium Discourses](index.html)
## Chapter 5: Related to Cultivation
### 44. Mindfulness

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){: #ref1} One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk is forgetful and lacks right knowledge, then that’s detrimental to his right mindfulness and right knowledge. If he lacks right mindfulness and right knowledge, then that’s detrimental to guarding his faculties, guarding the precepts, having no regrets, gladness, joy, calm, happiness, concentration, seeing as it really is and knowing as it truly is, disenchantment, lack of desire, and liberation. If he lacks liberation, then that will be detrimental to nirvāṇa.
{: #p2}

3\. “If a monk is not forgetful and possesses right knowledge, he readily cultivates right mindfulness and right knowledge. If he possesses right mindfulness and right knowledge, he readily cultivates guarding his faculties, guarding the precepts, having no regrets, gladness, joy, calm, happiness, concentration, [486a] seeing as it really is and knowing as it truly is, disenchantment, lack of desire, and liberation. If he possesses liberation, then he readily cultivates nirvāṇa.”
{: #p3}
4\. The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.
