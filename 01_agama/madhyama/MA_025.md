<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0454a03" target="_blank">T26.1.454a3-c17</a>. The only known parallel is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.162" target="_blank">AN 5.162</a>. While there are a few minor variations in wording, especially in the five similes used to illustrate the five methods, these two texts are identical in their meaning and structure.<br/>
The Taisho editors made a note about <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0129a27" target="_blank">SĀ 496</a> having a possible relationship with this <em>sūtra</em>. It recommends how two monks involved in a dispute should examine themselves and others to discipline themselves. There doesn’t appear to be a direct textual relationship with this <em>sūtra</em>, but they do both address the issue of monks getting upset with each other’s behavior. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>five ways to eliminate irritation</em>. C. <span class="ch">五除惱法</span>, P. <em>pañcā aghatapaṭivinayā</em>. The C. <span class="ch">惱</span> here is a general term for irritation, vexation, anxiety, and similar unpleasant feelings that cause distress. P. <em>aghata</em> lit. means “to be angered” and generally refers to irritation or annoyance. Throughout the <em>sūtra</em> below, <span class="ch">惱</span> is translated as <span class="ch">恚惱</span>, which I’ve rendered to English as “to be angered” as when a pet peeve or irritating situation causes a flare of emotion. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>their mind has some purity</em>. C. <span class="ch">心少有淨</span>, P. <em>labhati ca kālena kālaṁ cetaso vivaraṁ cetaso pasādaṁ</em>. In AN 5.162, the parallel expression is somewhat more verbose, meaning something like “who gets an openness and clarity of heart from time to time.” The C. has “purity” (<span class="ch">淨</span>) here where we’d expect the original to be S. <em>prasāda</em> (P. <em>pasāda</em>). This word has many meanings in S. for a good heart ranging from kindness to clarity. It also sometimes means “faithfulness” specifically. This particular part stands out in an otherwise mechanical passage, apparently meaning that a person’s mental conduct is sometimes pure.<br/>
The Pali expression is repeated in the last three items of this list, while here in MĀ 25 the next two items use the more standard “mental conduct” alongside physical and verbal conduct. The result is that it seems more out of place, but it’s equally unusual in AN 5.162 even if it was applied more consistently than here. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>forest monk</em>. C. <span class="ch">阿練若比丘</span> (EMC. •a-len-niă-bii-k‘iəu = <em>araña bhikhu</em>). <span class="ch">阿練若</span> is a translit. of Pr. <em>araña</em> (G. <em>araṃña</em>, P. <em>arañña</em>, S. <em>araṇya</em>), which lit. means “forest, wilderness.” Applied to a monk, it usu. means a renunciate who lives away from towns and cities in remote forests or other types of uninhabited areas. This qualifier doesn’t occur in AN 5.162. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5"><em>hidden by moss and grass</em>. C. <span class="ch">藳草所覆</span>, P. <em>sevālapaṇakapariyonaddhā</em>. The P. expression lit. means “overgrown by (<em>pariyonaddhā</em>) aquatic plants and moss (<em>sevālapaṇaka</em>).” Interestingly, a variant reading replaces <span class="ch">藳</span> (“straw”) with <span class="ch">苔</span> (“moss”). I’ve adopted this other reading given that it agrees with the Pali. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>I said I would discuss five ways to eliminate irritation, and so I have done that.</em>. C. <span class="ch">我向所說五除惱法者，因此故說</span>. This brief conclusion to Śāriputra’s discourse is one of the few places that MĀ 25 and AN 5.162 disagree. In AN, Sāriputta concludes instead with: “Relying on a person who is impressive all around, the mind becomes confident” (<em>samantapāsādikaṁ, āvuso, puggalaṁ āgamma cittaṁ pasīdati</em>).
